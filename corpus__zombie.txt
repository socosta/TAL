'''''The Beyond''''' ( 
In Louisiana's Seven Doors Hotel in 1927, a lynch mob murders an artist named Schweick, whom they believe to be a warlock. This opens one of the Seven Doors of Death, allowing the dead to cross into the world of the living. Several decades later, Liza, a young woman from New York, inherits the hotel and plans to re-open it. Her renovation work activates the hell portal, and she contends with increasingly strange incidents. A plumber named Joe investigates flooding in the cellar and a demonic hand gouges out his eye. His body and another are later discovered by a hotel maid, Martha.
Liza encounters a blind woman named Emily, who warns that reopening the hotel would be a mistake. Joe's wife Mary-Anne and their daughter Jill arrive at the hospital morgue to claim Joe's corpse. Jill finds her mother lying on the floor unconscious, her face burned by acid. Liza meets with Dr. John McCabe, and receives a phone call informing her of Mary-Anne's death. After the funerals, Liza encounters Emily at the hotel. Emily tells Liza the story of Schweick, and warns her to not enter room 36. When Emily examines Schweick's painting, she begins to bleed and flees the hotel.
Liza ignores Emily's advice, and investigates room 36. She discovers an ancient book titled ''Eibon''. She sees Schweick's corpse nailed to the bathroom wall. She flees the room in terror, but is stopped by John. She takes him to room 36 but both the corpse and the book are gone. Liza describes her fearful encounters with Emily, but John insists that Emily is not real. While in town, Liza spots a copy of ''Eibon'' in the window of a book store, but when she rushes in to grab it, a different book is in its place. The shop owner says the book has been there for years, prompting Liza to remark to John that perhaps it is all in her head.  At the hotel, a worker named Arthur attempts to repair the same leak as Joe, but is killed off-screen by ghouls.
Liza's friend Martin visits the public library to find the hotel's blueprints. He is struck by a sudden force and falls from a ladder, resulting in paralysis. Spiders ravage his face and kill him. Martha is cleaning the bathroom in Room 36 when Joe's animated corpse emerges from the bathtub. Joe pushes her head into an exposed nail, killing her and destroying one of her eyes. The walking corpses of Schweik, Joe, Mary-Anne, Martin and Arthur invade Emily's house. She pleads with them to leave her alone, and insists she will not return with Schweik. She commands her guide dog to attack the corpses, but the dog turns on Emily, tearing out her throat.
At the hotel, spirits terrorize Liza. John breaks into Emily's house, which appears to have been abandoned for years, and finds ''Eibon''. He returns to the hotel and tells Liza that it is a gateway to Hell. They flee to the hospital, but it has been overrun by zombies. Liza is attacked, but John gets a gun out of his desk and shoots the shambling corpses. Only Harris and Jill are found still alive, but Harris is killed by flying shards of glass. Jill, having shown signs of possession since the funeral, finally attacks Liza. John is forced to kill Jill.
Escaping the zombies, John and Liza rush down a set of stairs but find themselves back in the basement of the hotel. They move forward through the flooded labyrinth and stumble into a supernatural wasteland of dust and corpses. No matter which direction they travel, they find themselves back at their starting point. They are ultimately blinded just like Emily, succumb to the darkness, and disappear.

From a contemporary reviews, Tim Pulleine (''Monthly Film Bulletin'') stated that the film allows for "two or three visually striking passages-and granting that, from Bava onwards, narrative concision has not been the strong suit for Italian horror movies-the film is still completely undone by its wildly disorganized plot." The review also critiqued the dub, noting its "sheer ineptitude".
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, ''The Beyond'' received positive reviews by 61% of 18 reviews; the average rating was 6.2/10.
''Time Out'' conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.

'''''The Serpent and the Rainbow''''' is a 1988 American horror film directed by Wes Craven and starring Bill Pullman. The script by Richard Maxwell and Adam Rodman is loosely based on the The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|non-fiction book of the same name by ethnobotanist Wade Davis, wherein Davis recounted his experiences in Haiti investigating the story of Clairvius Narcisse, who was allegedly poisoned, buried alive, and revived with a herbal brew which produced what was called a zombie.
In 1978, a Haitian man named Christophe (Conrad Roberts) mysteriously dies in a French missionary clinic, while outside a voodoo parade marches past his window with a burning coffin.  The next morning, Christophe is buried in a traditional Catholic funeral, at which his sister cries over his body and prays for his soul.  Onlooking is a mysterious black man dressed in a suit who was also outside Christophe's hospital window on the night he died.  As the coffin is lowered into the ground, Christophe's eyes open and tears roll down his cheeks. 
Seven years later, Dennis Alan (an ethnobotanist and anthropologist from Harvard University) narrowly escapes the Amazon Jungle and returns to Boston after acquiring rare herbs and medicines from a local shaman.  During his ordeal, Alan drinks a hallucinogenic potion and experiences a horrifying image of the same black man from Christophe's funeral, surrounded by corpses in a bottomless pit.  Alan also sees his totem jaguar spirit which leads him out of the jungle to safety.
Back in Boston, Alan is approached by a large pharmaceutical corporation looking to investigate a drug used in the Voodoo religion of Haiti to create zombies.  The company wants Alan to acquire the drug for mass production and use it as a type of "super anesthetic".  The corporation provides Alan with significant funds and sends him to Haiti where the country is in the middle of a revolution.  Alan's exploration in Haiti to find the drug, assisted by the doctor Marielle (Cathy Tyson), locates Christophe who is alive again after having been buried for dead seven years before.  Shortly thereafter, Alan is taken into custody by the Haitian authorities, with the commander of the ''Tonton Macoute'' (Captain Dargent Peytraud (Zakes Mokae) - the same black man from both Christophe's funeral and Alan's vision in the Amazon) warning Alan to leave Haiti.  Alan is at first not harmed by Peytraud, due to Alan's status as a U.S. citizen.  
Alan refuses to leave, and continues to investigate. He encounters a local witch doctor, Mozart (Brent Jennings), who is reported to have knowledge of the zombie drug and the procedure necessary for its creation.  Alan pays Mozart for a sample of the drug, but Mozart sells him a fake substitute of rat poison instead.  After embarrassing Mozart in public, the Voodoo witch doctor agrees to show Alan exactly how to produce the zombie drug for a fee of $1000 to which Alan agrees.  Before gaining this knowledge, however, Alan is arrested a second time by the ''Tonton Macoutes'' and tortured.  After having his scrotum nailed into a chair, Alan is dumped on a street with the message clear that he had best leave Haiti before he is killed.  Alan, however, still refuses to do so and meets with Mozart to create the zombie drug.   
A few hours before picking up the final product, Alan has a terrifying dream.  This was planted in his head by Peytraud, revealed to be an evil ''bokor'' who turns enemies into zombies and steals their souls.  When Alan wakes up, he is lying next to Christophe's sister who has been beheaded.  The ''Tonton Macoutes'' enter, take photos, and frame Alan for murder.  Brought to Peytraud, Peytraud tells Alan to leave the country and never return, lest he be convicted of the framed murder, executed, and then his soul stolen by Peytraud.  He puts Alan on an airplane at gunpoint, but Mozart sneaks onboard at the last minute and gives Alan the zombie drug for free.  Mozart simply asks Alan to tell people about him, so that Mozart can achieve international fame. Alan agrees and returns to Boston with his mission apparently completed.  
At a celebration dinner, the wife of Alan's employer is possessed by Peytraud, who warns Alan of his own imminent death. Thereafter Alan returns to Haiti, where his only ally, a ''houngan'' named Lucien Celine, is killed by Peytraud through dark magic causing a scorpion to materialize inside Celine's throat; Mozart is beheaded at the same time as a sacrifice for Peytraud's evil power.  Alan is then sprayed with the zombie powder which "kills" him; afterwards, Peytraud steals Alan's body from an American medical clinic before Alan's death can be reported to the American Embassy.  Peytraud takes Alan to a graveyard where, helpless in his coffin, Alan sees that Peytraud has captured Marielle and will kill her as a sacrifice to Baron Samedi.  Peytraud further shows Alan the soul of Lucien Celine in a ''canari''. Alan is then buried alive with a tarantula to "keep him company".  Waking up screaming in his coffin a few hours later, Alan is rescued by Christophe who was also turned into a zombie by Peytraud many years earlier and now lives in a cemetery thinking that he is still dead.
Having escaped Peytraud's trap, Alan returns to the ''Tonton Macoute'' headquarters looking for Marielle. There, Alan and his jaguar spirit defeat Peytraud and send the evil bokor's soul to Hell.  As the Haitian people celebrate the downfall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Marielle proclaims "The nightmare is over".

The film is based on Wade Davis' The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|non-fiction book of the same name - Davis had agreed to sell the rights for the book on the condition that Peter Weir would direct and Mel Gibson would star in the film. However, neither Weir or Gibson would be involved in the project. Wes Craven eventually signed on as the film's director.
''The Serpent and the Rainbow'' was filmed in Boston, Massachusetts, Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, and in Haiti. During production in Haiti, the local government informed the cast and crew that they could not guarantee their safety for the remainder of the film's shoot because of the political strife and civil turmoil that was occurring during that time; as a result, production was relocated to the Dominican Republic for the remainder of the shoot.
In an interview, Craven stated that unlike his previous films that had problems with the Motion Picture Association of America, the first cut got an R rating without any problems. According to an article from Fangoria #71, the original cut was three hours long but Craven felt that it was too long and talky so it was cut down to 98 minutes. It was then test screened to the audience and their reactions were favorable.
''The Serpent and the Rainbow'' was released theatrically in the United States by Universal Pictures on February 5, 1988. It grossed $19,595,031 at the box office.
The film received mixed reviews from critics, it currently holds a 60% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews.

'''''House of the Dead 2''''' (alternately titled '''''House of the Dead II: Dead Aim''''') is a 2005 film and a sequel to the 2003 horror film, ''House of the Dead''. The film was directed by Michael Hurst and premiered at the Sitges Film Festival in Spain on October 14, 2005, and premiered in the United States on the Syfy on February 11, 2006.
A few months after the events of the first film, Professor Roy Curien at the fictional Cuesta Verde University (CVU), has managed to subdue and contain a "Hyper sapiens" specimen, who is revealed to be his son, Rudy Curien, (a survivor of the Isla Del Monte incident from the first film). Curien experiments on another survivor (Alicia), trying to determine the source of her immortality, with apparent disregard for the rotted state of Alicia's body. When Curien has created a serum that he believes will bring back the dead and grant immortality, Curien murders one of his students and injects her with the serum. She returns to life, infects Curien and breaks out of the building.
A month later, the university has a full-fledged outbreak, which is confirmed by AMC reconnaissance teams. Jake Ellis, an agent for AMS, goes in search of fellow agent Alexandra "Nightingale" Morgan. He finds her on a date at a restaurant, where she must execute several infected people before she returns to base with Ellis. They are ordered to retrieve a blood sample from the originally infected specimen on campus; missiles will level the campus at midnight, regardless of whether the agents are still present or not. She assigns a gender-mixed Special Forces team of U.S. Marines to provide them with backup. Ellis openly questions the competence of the soldiers, leading to friction between the two units. Upon arrival at CVU, the soldiers encounter zombies. One soldier panics and another becomes infected after his gun jams. When the others discover his injury, they sever his infect arm, but he turns and infects the team medic; both are executed by Ellis. The team continues forward into the university proper.
They proceed to battle through the hordes of infected, splitting into two teams. Two female soldiers, Lieutenant Alison Henson and Private Maria Rodriguez, and a male soldier, Bart, investigate the dorms. They break into a female dormitory where they find the deceased naked body of a zombie. Bart attempts to pose with the corpse and is bitten by a mosquito trapped in the room. Fearing contamination but unwilling to execute Bart, who is threatening them with a handgun, Henson handcuffs Bart to a radiator and the two soldiers exit the room, falling back to the van. Meanwhile, the second team, including Ellis and Nightingale, are attacked multiple times. Eventually, every soldier escorting them is killed, including the leader of the unit, Sergeant Griffin. They fight their way to the professor's laboratory and find the original specimen still imprisoned, as well as a pair of students who had survived. They enter the confinement room and extract blood from the zombie, but are forced to kill it when it breaks free. The two students Lonny and Sarah, who had allowed them into the confinement room are overrun and torn apart by zombies, and Ellis and Nightingale escape while the zombies are feeding on the bodies.
Henson and Rodriguez make it to the extraction vehicle. There, they prepare to rescue Nightingale and Ellis, but Rodriguez is bitten by a zombie who was locked in the back of the van by the soldier assigned to guard it. Henson executes Rodriguez, and the duo arrive in front of the science building as Nightingale and Ellis fight their way through a horde of zombies. Ellis and Nightingale saved by Henson, but the blood sample vial is destroyed in the process. They are forced to turn back, with ten minutes before the military releases the missile level the campus, and fight their way back to the confinement room. They retrieve a second vial, but Henson is bitten on the ankle. She remains behind and commits suicide, as Nightingale and Ellis escape before the missile strikes the campus and only Ellis made it out but Nightingale trapped surrounded by zombies. Bart breaks free from the dormitory by amputating his hand and forces Ellis to hand over the vial. Bart decides to kill Ellis anyway, Nightingale survives and kills Bart. His dying action is to pull the pin on a hand grenade, destroying the vial in the process. Nightingale is wounded but uncertain of whether she's infected. Ellis refuses to execute her, as the two leave together and headed to the city, finding that the infection has spread to the rest of the city.

Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 1/5 stars and wrote, "Whereas [the first] film was so bad it was almost good (at least we could laugh at it), this straight-to-video sequel is just flat-out bad, and unfortunately, it's flat-out dull. ... ''House of the Dead II'' commits the ultimate celluloid sin - it's boring."
A third film, currently titled ''House of the Dead 3'', with the name subject to change, has been discussed since late 2006. Michael Hurst is replacing Uwe Boll as the director of this movie, Unlike ''House of the Dead 2'', the producers aren't planning on releasing ''House of the Dead 3'' direct to DVD, but to theaters. The film starred Dean Cain and ended up with the title ''Dead and Deader'' when premiered on the SyFy Channel in December 2006 and released straight-to-DVD in 2007. No ''House of the Dead'' references were included in the final film.

'''''City of the Living Dead''''' (Italian: ''Paura nella città dei morti viventi'' [English translation: ''Fear in the City of the Living Dead''], also known as '''''The Gates of Hell''''') is a 1980 Italian horror film directed by Lucio Fulci. It is the first installment of the unofficial ''Gates of Hell'' trilogy which also includes ''The Beyond'' and ''The House by the Cemetery''. Fulci makes an uncredited cameo appearance as Dr. Joe Thompson in the film.
In New York City, during a séance held in the apartment of medium Theresa, Mary Woodhouse (Catriona MacColl) experiences a traumatic vision of a priest, Father Thomas (Fabrizio Jovine), hanging himself from a tree branch in a cemetery of the remote village of Dunwich. When the images overwhelm her, Mary breaks the circle and falls to the floor as if dead. The police, led by Sergeant Clay, interrogate Theresa, but fail to heed her warnings of an imminent evil. Outside the apartment building, Peter Bell (Christopher George), a journalist, tries to gain entry to the premises but is turned away. The following day, Mary is buried in a local cemetery on Long Island overlooking Manhattan and Peter visits her grave site. He discovers that Mary is still alive and uses a pick axe to free her. 
Peter and Mary visit Theresa who warns them that according to the ancient book of Enoch, the events Mary witnessed in her visions presage the eruption of the living dead into our world. The death of Father Thomas has somehow opened a door through which the living dead can enter and the invasion will commence on All Saints Day, just a few days away.
In Dunwich, Bob (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) wanders into an abandoned house, finding a rubber doll which inflates itself. Before he can use it, the sight of a rotting baby's corpse scares him away. At Junie's Lounge, the barman talks with two local men, Mr. Ross (Venantino Venanini) and Mike, about recent strange events for which Mr. Ross is inclined to blame Bob. When a mirror shatters and the wall cracks inexplicably, the men are scared and leave. Across town, Gerry (Carlo De Mejo), a psychiatrist, is in consultation with Sandra (Janet Agren), a neurotic patient, when Emily Robbins (Antonella Interlenghi), his 19-year-old girlfriend and personal assistant, arrives. She tells Gerry that she's on her way to meet Bob, whom she has been trying to help. That evening, Emily is slaughtered by the supernatural apparition of Father Thomas who smothers her with a maggot-covered hand.
A short distance away, Rose Kelvin (Daniela Doria) and Tommy Fisher (Michele Soavi), a teenage couple, are making out in Tommy's jeep when they too see the ghostly image of Father Thomas outside the jeep.  Father Thomas makes Rose's eyeballs bleed and she meets a ghastly fate by vomiting her entire guts out and Tommy is killed by getting his head ripped open. The next morning, there is no sign of Rose or Tommy, and Emily's body is found at the garage. Mr. Robbins tells the sheriff and Gerry of his suspicions about Bob. Meanwhile, Peter and Mary leave New York and embark upon their search for the town of Dunwich.
That evening, Bob sees Father Thomas hanging in the deserted house he frequents. At the local morgue, a mortician is bitten on his hand by the cadaver of elderly Jane Holden while trying to steal her jewelry. The apparition of the dead Emily pays a nocturnal visit to her little brother John-John (Luca Paisner). At Sandra's house, the corpse of Mrs. Holden appears without explanation on her kitchen floor. Sandra calls Gerry for help, but as soon as Gerry arrives, the body has disappeared. Investigating noises upstairs in Sandra's house, the doctor and patient witness broken glass fly from a shattered window into the wall opposite. The wall bleeds before their eyes, forcing them to flee the house. Meanwhile, Bob has taken refuge at the Ross household in the garage. When Mr. Ross's teenage daughter finds him and tries to comfort him after he tries to explain what's going on outside, the rabid patriarch enters, and mistakenly assumes that Bob is trying to seduce his daughter. The vicious Mr. Ross kills Bob by impaling his head on a drilling lathe.
The following morning, Peter and Mary follow a village priest's directions to the shunned village of Dunwich. Arriving at the graveyard, they begin searching for Father Thomas' tomb. There, they meet Gerry and Sandra, and the two couples exchange stories about their recent events. They begin to become acquainted at Gerry's office when a sudden violent storm blasts through the window, showering the four with maggots. When it's over, Gerry receives a distressing phone call from John-John Robbins explaining his dead sister has returned from the grave during the night and killed his parents. The four rush over the Robbins' house and Sandra offers to take the boy to her apartment while, Peter, Mary, and Gerry try to find the sheriff. Upon arriving to her apartment building, Sandra is killed by Emily, who rips Sandra's scalp off. John-John runs through the fog-shrouded streets of the town and is saved by Gerry who hands the boy over to the police.
At Junie's Lounge, Mr. Ross, Mike, and the barman are attacked and finally killed by the marauding ghouls as a state-of-emergency is declared over the radio. Mary, Peter, and Gerry arrive back at the graveyard as All Saints Day begins. They descend into Father Thomas' family tomb, discovering an underground grotto of skeletal remains and cobwebbed putrescences. Sandra suddenly appears as a zombie and kills Peter by ripping his brains out. Gerry impales her to a cave wall with a pitchfork through her chest before she can kill Mary. Mary and Gerry continue on until they reach a weird, stained-glass chamber coated in musk and dust. There, they face Father Thomas who has re-entered corporeal existence and an army of the undead. Father Thomas once again begins to use his powerful and mesmerizing stare making Mary's eyeballs bleed. Before his stare can turn Mary inside out, Gerry grabs a wooden cross and disembowels Father Thomas. The evil priest's decayed guts are punctured, and he and the massing zombies burst into flames and return to dust. The Gates of Hell have been closed just before the dead fully rise. Mary and Gerry exit from Father Thomas' tomb into the graveyard at morning to see John-John and the police. Mary and Gerry's relief turns to shock as the realization of the past events becomes all too clear. Mary begins to scream as John-John is running towards them before the film crumbles to black.

'''''Zombie Nightmare''''' is a 1986 zombie film produced and directed by Jack Bravman. It stars Adam West, Tia Carrere and Jon Mikl Thor, and was filmed in the suburbs of Montreal, Canada.
A little boy named Tony Washington (Jesse D'Angelo) watches his father William Washington (John Fasano) play in a baseball game. On the way home Tony, William and Tony's mother Louise (Francesca Bonacorsa) see a young girl (Tracy Biddle) about to be raped by two teenagers. William saves the young girl from being raped but is killed when one of the rapists fatally stabs him. 
Years pass and Tony (Jon Mikl Thor), now a musclebound teenage baseball player, is leaving a small grocery store where he had helped disrupt an attempted robbery. As he steps out of the store and into the road, he is run over by a gang of reckless teenagers consisting of Bob (Allan Fisler), Amy (Tia Carrere), Jim (Shawn Levy), Peter (Hamish McEwan), and Susie (Manon E. Turbide) and is killed. After his body is brought to his mother, Louise, she contacts one of her neighbors, a voodoo priestess, named Molly (Manuska Rigaud) to save her son. Molly explains to Louise that although she is unable to restore her son back to life, she can keep him between a state of life and death long enough for him to avenge himself. After Louise agrees, Molly resurrects Tony as a zombie, then uses her powers to aid him in his revenge.
The next night, the now zombified Tony is able to track down Peter and Susie at an academy's gymnasium and kills Peter by breaking his neck then Susie by crushing her skull with a baseball bat. The night afterwards, he is able to find and kill Jim by impaling him with the same bat before the latter could rape a waitress. Police detective 
Frank Sorrell (Frank Dietz) is soon investigating both incidents and initially agrees with a coroner that a large built, drug-fueled man is responsible. Sorrell brings his suspicions to his boss, police captain Tom Churchman (Adam West) and is told by him that they have already managed to find a suspect responsible that matches Sorrell's description and closes the case. 
Believing that the case has not been fully solved, Sorrell investigates photos that has Molly at both incidents and suggests to Churchman that they bring her in for questioning. However the captain quickly dismisses her as a "batty, voodoo palm reader that follows ambulances around" and sends him home to rest. Shortly afterwards, Churchman contacts Jim's father, Fred, and informs him of Molly's involvement in his son's death, then tells him to come to the police station. Before Fred could leave his home, he sees Tony approaching him and shoots him with a rifle. Tony quickly recovers and breaks Fred's neck, killing him. 
Knowing that they will be next, Bob and Amy decide to leave town. While at a garage getting money, Tony finds them and kills Bob by bashing his head against a car, then does the same to Amy against a door. While monitoring Tony's actions, Molly is held at gunpoint by Churchman to come with him and forced to show where Tony is going. The zombie makes his way to a cemetery with Sorrell following him. Molly and Churchman soon arrive, with both telling Sorrell that the priestess resurrected Tony to not only avenge himself, but also Molly herself as Churchman and Fred were the two that tried to rape her years ago, and that the captain was also the one who had killed Tony's father. Having learned that a zombie will lose its energy once it has avenged itself, Churchman shoots and kills Tony, then Molly as well. Before he could do the same to Sorrell to silence him as a witness, a second zombie rises out of a nearby grave and drags Churchman into the ground with him, presumably to Hell. A shocked Sorrell then inspects the grave and realizes the second zombie was Tony's father, then leaves.

Thor plays the zombie, and wrote much of the incidental music. This includes heavy metal riffs by his band, and synthesizer music played by the band ''Thorkestra.'' Several other heavy metal bands contribute to the soundtrack. The Motörhead hit "Ace of Spades" plays during the opening credits. Other bands heard on the soundtrack include Virgin Steele, Girlschool, Fist, and Death Mask, as well as a track by Thor's then wife and back up singer "Pantera" (not the band).
An edited version (editing out the gory scenes) of the film was featured in an episode of ''Mystery Science Theater 3000''.

†The "Pantera" that appears on the soundtrack is not the Texan heavy metal band (which was actually more of a glam band at the time) but Jon Mikl Thor's then-wife, a backup singer in his band Thor whose stage name was "Pantera".
The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures and Shapiro-Glickenhaus Entertainment in 1986.  It was subsequently released on VHS by New World Home Video.
The film was released on special edition DVD by Scorpion Releasing in 2010.
Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 1/5 stars and wrote, "''Zombie Nightmare'' is a horrible film by any standards but it's so deliciously goofy that you can't help but have fun with it."  Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict called it "a charmingly cheap z-grade zombie thriller".

'''''White Zombie''''' is a 1932 American Pre-Code Hollywood|Pre-Code horror film directed and independently produced by Victor and Edward Halperin. The screenplay by Garnett Weston, based on ''The Magic Island'' by William Seabrook, tells the story of a young woman's transformation into a zombie at the hands of an evil voodoo master. Béla Lugosi stars as the antagonist, Murder Legendre, with Madge Bellamy appearing as his victim. Other cast members included Robert W. Frazer, John Harron, and Joseph Cawthorn.''Variety'' film review; August 6, 1932, page 15.
Large portions of ''White Zombie'' were shot on the Universal Studios lot, borrowing many props and scenery from other horror films of the era. ''White Zombie'' opened in New York to negative reception, with reviewers criticizing the film's over-the-top story and weak acting performances. While the film made a substantial financial profit as an independent feature, it proved to be less popular than other horror films of the time.
''White Zombie'' is considered the first feature length zombie film. A sequel to the film, titled ''Revolt of the Zombies,'' opened in 1936. Modern reception to ''White Zombie'' has been more positive than its initial release. Some critics have praised the atmosphere of the film, comparing it to the 1940s horror film productions of Val Lewton, while others still have an unfavorable opinion on the quality of the acting.
On arrival in Haiti, Madeleine Short reunites with her fiancé Neil Parker, with imminent plans to be married. On the way to their lodging, the couple's coach passes Murder Legendre, an evil voodoo master, who observes them with interest and manages to grab Madeleine's scarf. Neil and Madeleine arrive at the home of the wealthy plantation owner, Charles Beaumont. Charles's love of Madeleine prompts him to meet Murder secretly in Murder's sugarcane mill, operated entirely by zombies. Charles wants to convince Madeleine to marry him and solicits Murder's supernatural assistance. Murder states that the only way to help Charles is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion. Beaumont agrees and surreptitiously gives the potion to Madeleine. Shortly after Madeleine and Neil's wedding ceremony, the potion takes effect on Madeleine and she appears to die. After her funeral, Murder and Charles enter Madeleine's tomb at night and Murder revives her as a zombie. Drunk and depressed, Neil imagines ghostly apparitions of Madeleine and goes to her tomb. Finding it empty, Neil seeks assistance from the local missionary, Dr. Bruner, who recounts how Murder turned many of his rivals into zombies, who now guard his estate. The two men journey to Murder's cliffside castle to rescue Madeleine.
At the castle, Charles has begun to regret Madeleine's transformation and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder's voodoo and is transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner stops her. Neil follows Madeleine to an escarpment, where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder's mental control over his zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off the cliff. Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off the cliff. Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder's death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.

''White Zombie'' went into development in early 1932.Rhodes 2001, p. 89 The Halperins leased office space from Universal Studios to get their film (then titled ''Zombie'') underway.Rhodes 2001, p. 91 The film's zombie theme was inspired by the Broadway play by Kenneth Webb titled ''Zombie''.Grant 2004, p. 210Kay 2008, p. 6 The screenplay for ''White Zombie'' was written by Garnett Weston. Weston's screenplay focuses more on action than dialog.Rhodes 2001, p. 95  To aid the Halperins, producer Phil Goldstone helped secure funds for ''White Zombie'' as he had for other independent films at the time.Rhodes 2001, p. 92
''White Zombie'' was filmed in eleven days in March 1932 and was shot at the Universal Studios lot and Bronson Canyon on such a small budget that it had to film at night. Other than Béla Lugosi and Joseph Cawthorn, the majority of the cast in ''White Zombie'' were actors whose fame had diminished since the silent film era. By the time Lugosi appeared in ''White Zombie'', he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film, ''Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula''. Sources vary about Lugosi's salary for ''White Zombie''. Claims range between US$500 to $900. Richard Sheffield, who was his close friend in the 1950s, reported a payment of $5,000 for ''White Zombie'' on Lugosi's tax returns.Rhodes 2001, p. 97Rhodes 2001, p. 105 The cast and crew's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed. Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively, stating that he was very pleasant and that he used to kiss her hand in the morning when they would come on to the set.Rhodes 2001, p. 98 In contrast, assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that "Lugosi wasn't really a friendly type" on set.
Phil Goldstone had previously worked with Bellamy and offered her the role of Madeleine Short for a salary of $5,000.Rhodes 2001, p. 99 For the role of Dr. Bruner, the Halperins looked for an actor with name value and decided to cast Joseph Cawthorn, who was then known to audiences only as comic relief in stage and film roles.Rhodes 2001, p. 100 Set designer Ralph Berger utilized the rented sets of previous Universal Studios films. These sets included the great halls from ''Dracula'', pillars and a hanging balcony from ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (1923), the dark corridors from ''Frankenstein'' (1931) and chairs from ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1927). In addition to Berger, assistant director William Cody and sound director L.E. "Pete" Clark earned their first film credit by working on ''White Zombie''.Rhodes 2001, p. 103 Jack Pierce, Lugosi's make-up artist on ''White Zombie'', had been responsible for the make-up of several other famous horror films of the era including ''Frankenstein'', ''The Wolf Man'', and ''The Mummy'' (1932).Rhodes 2001, p. 104
The music of ''White Zombie'' was supervised by Abe Meyer. Instead of using pre-recorded music, Meyer had orchestras record new versions of compositions for each specific film he was involved in. The music in ''White Zombie'' draws from works including Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition", Gaston Borch's "Incidental Symphonies", and Hugo Riesenfeld's "Death of the Great Chief".Rhodes 2001, p. 109 Other pieces on the ''White Zombie'' soundtrack include music written by Richard Wagner, H. Maurice Jacquet, Leo Kempenski, and Franz Liszt. The film begins with "Chant", a composition of wordless vocals and drumming, created by Universal Studios employee Guy Bevier Williams, a specialist in ethnic music.Rhodes 2001, p. 110
''White Zombie'' experienced distribution problems from the beginning, and went through several film studios including Columbia Studios and Educational Pictures before its initial release.Rhodes 2001, p. 111 United Artists had been distributing several independent and foreign films that year and bought the rights to release ''White Zombie''.Rhodes 2001, p. 113 A preview of ''White Zombie''s first cut was shown on June 16, 1932, in New York City.Rhodes 2001, p. 112 This print of ''White Zombie'' had a running time of 74 minutes, whereas the regular distribution prints ran for only 69 minutes.Rhodes 2001, p. 194
Most critical reviews focused on the poor acting and over-the-top storyline. William Boehnel of the ''New York World-Telegram'' stated: "The plot...is really ridiculous, but not so startlingly so as the acting."Rhodes 2001, p. 265 Thornton Delehaney of the ''New York Evening Post'' wrote, "[T]he story tries to out-Frankenstein ''Frankenstein'', and so earnest is it in its attempt to be thrilling that it overreaches its mark all along the line and resolves into an unintentional and often hilarious comedy." Irene Thirer of the New York ''Daily News'' wrote, "Many fantastic and eerie scenes are evolved, but most of them border on ludicrous".Rhodes 2001, p. 266 Industry trade reviews were more positive. ''The Film Daily'' wrote: "It rates with the best of this type of film [...] Bela Lugosi is very impressive and makes the picture worthwhile". ''Harrison's Reports'' wrote, "[The film] is certainly not up to the standards of ''Dracula'' or ''Frankenstein'', but the types of audience that go for horror pictures will enjoy it".Rhodes 2001, p. 267''Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports'' film review; August 6, 1932, page 126.
National media outlet reviewers were generally negative. Frederic Smith of ''Commonweal'' opined, "[The film is] interesting only in measure of its complete failure".  ''Liberty (1924-1950)|Liberty'' wrote, "If you do not get a shock out of this thriller, you will get one out of the acting". In ''Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair''s "Worst Movie of 1932" article, Pare Lorentz wrote about a "terrific deadlock with ''Blonde Venus'' holding a slight lead over ''White Zombie'', ''Bring 'Em Back Alive (1932 film)|Bring 'Em Back Alive'', and ''Murders in the Rue Morgue''".Rhodes 2001, p. 268 In the United Kingdom, press was mixed. ''The Kinematograph Weekly'' thought the film was "quite well acted, and has good atmosphere" but thought, too, it was "not for the squeamish or the highly intelligent".Rhodes 2001, p. 162 ''The Cinema News and Property Gazette'' thought the film was for the "less sophisticated" and that the "exaggerated treatment of the subject achieves reverse effect to thrill or conviction".Rhodes 2001, p.163 Years after the film's release, Victor Halperin expressed a distaste for his horror films: "I don't believe in fear, violence, and horror, so why traffic in them?"Rhodes 2001, p. 237
Modern critical reception has been mixed, with critics praising the film's atmosphere while deprecating the acting. ''Time Out London'' wrote, "Halperin shoots this poetic melodrama as trance... The unique result constitutes a virtual bridge between classic Universal horror and the later Val Lewton productions." Edward G. Bansk, a Val Lewton biographer, identified several flaws in ''White Zombie'', including poor acting, bad timing and other "haphazard and sloppy" film aspects. Bansk wrote, "Although ''White Zombie'' is a film with courage, a film difficult not to admire, its ambitions overstep competence of its principal players."Bansk 109
''White Zombie'' premiered on July 28, 1932, in New York City's Rivoli Theatre. The film received a mixed box office reception upon its initial release, but was a great financial success for an independent film at the time.Rhodes 2001, p. 271Rhodes 2001, p. 233 In 1933 and 1934, the film experienced positive box-office numbers in small towns in the United States, as well as in Germany under the title ''Flucht von der Teufelsinsel''. ''White Zombie'' was one of the few American horror films to be approved by the Nazis. The popularity of the film led Victor Halperin to a contract with Paramount Studios.Rhodes 2001, p. 266
Opening on July 29, 1932, in Providence, Rhode Island and Indianapolis, Indiana, the film grossed $9,900 and $5,000, respectively, following one-week engagements. ''Frankenstein'' and other contemporary horror films had grossed more in Providence, and the Indianapolis theater "wasn't too happy with ''White Zombie'', but what audiences saw it were pleased enough."Rhodes 2001, p. 269  In Cleveland, Ohio, ''White Zombie'' sold a record 16,728 tickets its first weekend on its initial release in August. In Montreal, Canada, the film opened August 3 at the Princess Theatre. The facade had been transformed into a "House of the Living Dead" and "zombies" walked atop the marquee. The film failed to gross its estimated $8,000 and earned only $6,500 following a one-week run at the Princess Theatre. In comparison, ''Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula'' had grossed $14,000 at Montreal's  Palace Theatre during its first week in March 1931.
''White Zombie'' was transferred from poor quality prints to VHS and Betamax in the 1980s. The film has been released on DVD from several companies - including K-Tel and Alpha Video - with varying image quality.
On the White Zombie compilation album ''Let Sleeping Corpses Lie'', the film is included as a hidden "easter egg". The film can be accessed by selecting Title 5 with a DVD remote control.

''White Zombie'' is considered to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies.Rhodes 2001, p. 13Prawer 1989, p. 68 Not many early horror films followed ''White Zombie'''s Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from ''White Zombie'', such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology.Kay 2008, p. 5 These films include: ''The Ghost Breakers'' (1940), ''King of the Zombies'' (1941), ''I Walked with a Zombie'' (1943), and ''The Plague of the Zombies'' (1966).Rhodes 2001, p. 183 These films all contain elements from ''White Zombie'' including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.Rhodes 2001, p. 184
Victor Halperin directed a ''White Zombie'' sequel, ''Revolt of the Zombies'', which was released in 1936. Béla Lugosi was considered for the role of villain Armand Louque, but the part went to Dean Jagger.Rhodes 2001, p. 171 Cinematographer Arthur Martinelli and producer Edward Halperin returned for the sequel.
Scenes from ''White Zombie'' have appeared in other films including Curtis Hanson's ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', Michael Almereyda's ''Nadja'', and Tim Burton's ''Ed Wood''.Rhodes 2001, p. 189 The heavy metal band White Zombie appropriated their name from the film. The group's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film, "[It's] a great film that not a lot of people know about...It amazes me that a film that is so readily available can be so lost."Rhodes 2001, p. 190 In 1997, the Janus company released a model kit based on the Murder Legendre character.
In 2009, it was announced that Tobe Hooper would direct a remake of ''White Zombie''.
In 2013, Walkabout Publishing released Stephen D. Sullivan's adaptation of ''White Zombie''.

'''''Hood of the Living Dead''''' is a 2005 direct-to-video zombie movie about a regenerative formula bringing the dead back to life.
Ricky (Carl Washington) is a young scientist living in a poor and violent section of Oakland with his brother Jermaine (Brandon Daniels). Since his parents died, Ricky has been working hard at a laboratory trying to perfect a regenerative formula that could heal dead cells in animals.  
Ricky disapproves of Jermaine's friends Marco (Raul Martinez) and Kevin (Derek Taylor II) and tells his brother that they will be moving to a safer community at the end of the month. While out with his friends one night, Jermaine is threatened by a group of drug dealers that claim that his brother Ricky reported their illegal activities to the police.
That night Jermaine is killed in a drive by shooting. Ricky uses his regenerative formula on Jermaine's corpse. When nothing happens, Ricky enlists Marco and Kevin to exact his revenge against his brother's killers. Subsequently, Jermaine comes back to life and also pursues his killers.
The zombie infection then spreads through flesh wounds, turning the dealers, Ricky's girlfriend, and an ambulance crew into zombies. Once Ricky realizes the situation is out of control, he calls his boss, Dr. Richards (Victor Zaragoza) and tells him of the disaster.  Dr. Richards, not wanting the virus to spread out of control, calls in a mercenary to deal with the problem. The group hunts down the remaining zombies, but the mercenary gets turned into a zombie in the process.  Ricky returns home with Dr. Richards, who has been infected.  The now-undead Dr. Richards attacks Ricky, but the also-undead Jermaine comes to Ricky's rescue by killing Richards. Jermaine's reanimated corpse then turns on Ricky, who is forced to shoot his own brother.
As the movie ends, a lone driver (Co-Director Eduardo Quiroz in a brief cameo) sees the abandoned ambulance and pulls over to help. He is attacked by the undead hospital crew, leaving the potential for a sequel open.

'''''The Dead Next Door''''' is a 1989 zombie horror film written, produced and directed by J. R. Bookwalter.
The movie features an elite team of soldiers, the "Zombie Squad", who have been enlisted by the government to deal with a growing epidemic of zombies, while scientists work towards a cure for the virus that creates them. The squad must also fight against a religious cult which wishes to protect and enable the zombies, believing them to be a punishment ordained by God. Many of the characters are named after people who have made their marks in the horror and zombie movie fields, such as "Savini", "George A. Romero|Romero", "Raimi" and "King".
Sam Raimi served as executive producer on the film under the pseudonym 'The Master Cylinder' using a portion of his payment from ''Evil Dead II''. 
The film was shot on Super-8, which is an amateur grade film generally only used for making home movies. Everyone involved worked on the film for a deferred salary. The film is notable for highly graphic gore effects.
AllMovie wrote, "very stylish for what is essentially an epic-scale home movie [...], this remains Bookwalter's best effort", comparing the film's fast pace to that of a "live-action video game".
The score for the film was composed by director J. R. Bookwalter. The soundtrack has been released on CD and in MP3 format by Tempesound.

'''''Revolt of the Zombies''''' is a 1936 American horror film directed and produced by the Halperin Brothers which stars Dean Jagger and Dorothy Stone. It is one of the earliest zombie films. Although it was conceived as a loose sequel to Victor Halperin's moderately successful 1932 film ''White Zombie'', when compared with Halperin's previous work, this film is generally regarded as a disappointment.
On the Franco-Austrian Frontier during World War I, an Oriental priest, chaplain of a French colonial regiment, is condemned to life imprisonment because he possesses the power to turn men into zombies. In his prison cell, the priest prepares to burn a parchment containing the location of the secret formula. Gen. Mazovia (Roy D'Arcy) kills the priest and takes the partially burned parchment. After the war, an expedition of representatives from the Allied countries with colonial interests are sent to Cambodia to find and destroy forever the so-called "Secret of the Zombies". The group includes Colonel Mazovia; a student of dead languages, Armand Louque (Dean Jagger); Englishman Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland); General Duval (George Cleveland); and his daughter Claire (Dorothy Stone).
Armand falls in love with Claire, who accepts his proposal of marriage to spite Clifford, whom she really loves. Later, when Claire runs to Cliff for comfort following an accident, Armand breaks the engagement, leaving her free to marry Cliff. Further accidents caused by Mazovia result in the natives refusing to work, forcing the expedition to return to Phnom Penh. Armand finds a clue which he had overlooked before and returns to Angkor against orders.
After viewing an ancient ceremony at a temple, Armand follows one of the servants of a high priest out of the temple, through a swamp, to a mysterious bronze doorway. When the servant leaves, Armand goes through the door to a room paneled in bronze, with an idol holding a gong. He accidentally strikes the gong, and a panel in the wall opens, revealing a small metal tablet. He translates the inscription and realizes that it is the secret for which they have all been looking. He alone now has the power to make zombies out of people, and begins with a practice run on his servant before using his zombie powers in an attempt to coerce the fickle Claire in the movie's climax.

In November 1935, trades papers announced that brothers Victor Halperin and Edward Halperin would create a sequel to ''White Zombie'' that would be produced by Academy Pictures. A camera crew was sent to Angkor, Indochina to film background shots for the film. Production on ''Revolt of the Zombies'' was behind schedule in January with no script complete while the Halperins planned on filming in February.Rhodes 2001, p. 171 The film only began production on March 9, 1936 with the shoot being finished later in the month.Rhodes 2001, pp. 172-174
In May 1936, however, the Halperins encountered legal troubles in the form of a suit from Amusement Securities Corporation, a company that had helped finance ''White Zombie''. Amusement Securities alleged that its contract for the earlier film gave it the exclusive right to use the world "zombie" in motion picture titles. Amusement Securities sent letters to theaters who planned to showcase ''Revolt of the Zombies'', warning them not to show the film. As the film's premiere approached, Judge Waservogel of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that screenings of the film could take place until a judgement in the suit was reached, and appointed attorney Henry Hoffman to referee the case. On June 27, 1936, Hoffman issued an opinion in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding Amusement Securities $11,500 in damages and legal fees and prohibiting the Halperins from promoting ''Revolt of the Zombies'' as a sequel to ''White Zombie''.
Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle called it an uninvolving follow-up to ''White Zombie'' that could not have been saved by Bela Lugosi.

'''''They Came Back''''' ( The film was screened at the Hamburg Fantasy Filmfest in Hamburg, Germany|Germany, the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy|Italy, and the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Canada.
Unlike the typical zombie film, in which the physically deformed undead compulsively feed on or otherwise harm the human population, the physically normal undead in ''They Came Back'' seek only to reintegrate themselves into the everyday life of the small French town where they formerly lived, or so it seems.
The recently deceased of an anonymous French town suddenly return to life, calmly streaming forth from a cemetary in a silent procession. The town council, led by the mayor (Victor Garrivier), makes plans to house the returned and help reintroduce them to society. The mayor informs the council that the event has lasted for roughly two hours throughout France, returning an estimated 70 million people to life nation-wide, with more than 13,000 in their town alone, all of whom had died within the previous 10 years.
However, the reintegration poses challenges. The returned suffer from effects similar to those that may be seen after severe concussion, such as disorientation, sleep disturbance, and wandering.  Former professionals among the returned are moved to menial jobs when it becomes clear that, although they can perform rote tasks, they can no longer engage in spontaneous problem solving or planning, and that even their apparent consciousness may be an illusion. This behaviour adds to the growing sentiment that the returned are different from their former selves. However, while the returned generally function sluggishly during the day, a doctor named Gardet (Frédéric Pierrot) has become suspicious of the returned after observing some of them clandestinely attending animated meetings, conducted in the middle of the night, during which their symptoms seem to disappear.
Nonetheless, the returned reunite with their former loved ones: the mayor's wife, Martha (Catherine Samie), with the mayor; a  6-year-old boy, Sylvain (Saady Delas), with his parents, Isham (Djemel Barek) and Véronique (Marie Matheron); a young man, Mathieu (Jonathan Zaccaï), with his wife, Rachel (Géraldine Pailhas). Rachel is initially reluctant to see Mathieu, until one day he follows her home, acting as though he never left. Rachel eventually accepts him, and the two make love. In addition to the nocturnal meetings of the returned, Gardet also observes the gradual reunion of Rachel and Mathieu with growing concern, but when he tries to warn her of possible danger, Rachel rebuffs him.
One evening a series of explosions tears through the town, apparently detonated by the returned in an act of mass sabotage but without inflicting any casualties.  In the chaos, the returned head for a network of underground tunnels. The mayor attempts to stop his wife from leaving with the rest but begins to feel ill and, after Martha urges him to "give in", apparently dies, only to appear later in the tunnels among the returned. The military responds by gassing the returned with a chemical that induces a permanent coma.
After guiding some of the returned to the tunnels, Mathieu makes his way back to Rachel, and recounts to her the events leading to his fatal car accident. He reveals that he crashed the car while looking for her after the two had fought. Rachel follows him into the tunnels, tearfully kissing him before he disappears into the darkness. She returns to the surface and observes the military carting away the comatose bodies. The bodies are laid atop their graves in the cemetery and slowly vanish.

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 78%, based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.
In one of the more negative reviews, ''The Village Voice'' remarked that "''They Came Back'' suffers from long-winded earnestness and, despite some poetic conceits, its allegory ultimately doesn't parse."

'''''The Boneyard''''' is a 1991 American direct-to-video horror film directed by James Cummins.
The film plunges into the nightmarish experiences of a portly, depressed psychic (Deborah Rose), whose involvement in a grisly child-murder case leads her and her detective partner (Ed Nelson) to an imposing, fortress-like mortuary. Chen (Robert Yun Ju Ahn), the owner of the funeral home and prime suspect in the case, claims the three mummified corpses in question are not children but ancient demons known as "kyoshi". It seems the little monsters have been around for centuries as a result of an age-old curse and can only be placated with offerings of human flesh — with which the mortician has been supplying them his entire life. When Chen is jailed on murder charges, the under-fed ghouls awaken in search of dinner, trapping the staff inside the mortuary walls and devouring them. The survivors, including Rose and Nelson, use every means at their disposal to combat the demons, which have possessed the bodies of morgue attendant Mrs. Poopinplatz (Phyllis Diller) and her poodle, mutating them into hideous monsters.
Shooting took place in Statesville, North Carolina, in 1989.  In December 1989, a botched special effect caused a fire.
Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict called it "good, goofy fun."

'''''Severed''''' is a 2005 Canadian zombie horror film directed by Carl Bessai and set in a remote logging community following an incident where a genetic experiment goes wrong. The film was titled '''''Severed: Forest of the Dead''''' in the United States.
In a forest on a remote island, a team of loggers led by Mac (Julian Christopher) face opposition from protesters led by Rita, a known eco-terrorist. The company that employs Mac's team is conducting an experiment in the area, supervised by Carter, a chemist. One of Mac's loggers hits a spiked tree and suffers a wound from his chainsaw. The sap of the tree infects his wounds and causes him to undergo a transformation.
The president of the company decides to send his son Tyler to investigate the loss of contact with the loggers, hoping Tyler will learn more about the industry. When he arrives, Tyler discovers most of the loggers and protesters have become zombies. He comes across a bunker where Mac, Rita and Carter have taken shelter, along with other survivors including Mac's apprentice Luke (Michael Teigen). The company learns of the zombie outbreak when a chemist examining one of Carter's samples at their lab is infected by the altered sap. Tyler's father wishes to send an evacuation to rescue his son but is overruled by the other members of the board, who decide to set up a quarantine.
The survivors leave the bunker and attempt to drive off the island, but they find the road blocked by the company. They get separated and several more victims fall to the zombies. After reuniting at the logging base, Mac recovers another truck and the group decides to travel to another abandoned facility in the hopes of radioing for help. At the camp, Mac finds the radio dead, while Tyler and Rita begin to become close. Luke is dragged off by the zombies when Carter becomes too frightened to help him. Later, Carter becomes overwhelmed by guilt and confesses that the company had him conducting genetic experiments to grow the trees faster, leading to an increase in profit.
The next day, the remaining survivors attempt to drive to another potential exit but encounter more zombies. Mac loses hope when he sees Luke as a zombie, as he considered Luke a son, but Rita tries to console him. They find the road blocked but hear a chopper approaching. Instead of saving them, however, the chopper opens fire. They are rescued by another renegade band of surviving loggers, who reveal that the company plans to kill them all. The militaristic nature of the camp disturbs the remaining survivors, especially a sadistic game they play in which a selected member of the camp must kill a certain number of zombies in a pen. That night, the head of the camp attempts to rape Rita, but Tyler defends her. They admit their attraction and have sex. The next day, Carter is selected to enter the pen, but he becomes frightened and jams his gun, ending up needing to be rescued. He is bullied mercilessly for this by the loggers, who blame him for the crisis.
His spirit broken, Carter takes an axe and leaves the camp alone that night. Zombies wander in through the open gate and kill everyone except Mac, Rita and Tyler, who wake up and flee. At the gate, Mac is bitten. Rita confesses to him as he turns that she was the one who spiked the tree, and with his last breaths as a human, Mac forgives her. While running through the woods, Tyler and Rita hear Carter, who is surrounded by zombies, screaming for help. Tyler attempts to save him, but they are both overrun by zombies. Rita, now the last survivor, sees the lights of a car and happens upon a road she begins to follow in hopes of escape. In his mansion, Tyler's father looks sadly at a picture of himself with Tyler, realizing that his actions led to the loss of his son.

'''''I, Zombie: The Chronicles of Pain''''' is a film which was released by Fangoria Films in 1998; it was written, directed, produced and scored by Andrew Parkinson.  It tells the story of a young man who gets infected by being bitten by a zombie and gradually starts turning into one himself.
The film opens in mockumentary style with a woman, Sarah, talking about her boyfriend Mark in the past tense.
Mark skips Sarah's event for his research field trip, and she is very displeased with his decision. Mark travels out to the woods to collect moss samples when he stumbles across a rusty decaying station wagon. Intrigued, he continues down the path and eventually finds an abandoned farmhouse. He enters the house, explores the rooms, and stumbles across an injured man propped up against a wall.  When he hears a woman scream, he rushes to her aid and finds her having a seizure on a dirty mattress. He brushes her hair out of her face to comfort her and sees that she has the same sort of scars and deformities that the man had. He picks her up and carries her outside, and she bites his neck. He promptly drops her and runs away, eventually collapsing in a nearby field.
Back at home, Sarah calls an investigator to report Mark missing for three weeks. Mark wakes up, thinks to himself about how he doesn't know how long he's been unconscious, and admits to killing his first victim, a camper in the woods. He recalls how he had no control of the situation. He decides he has to hide and rents a new apartment. He looks at his bite wound in a mirror and notices it is beginning to look worse. He collapses, suffers a minor seizure, and reports it in his digital log, along with how he has not eaten in six days and has to find another victim.
As his condition worsens, he begins to accept and study it, keeping everything recorded in logbooks or his digital recorder. He still appears normal and continues to live and function in society, although his bite wound will not heal and the surrounding tissue is starting to decay. He picks up a hitchhiker, knocks him out with chloroform, and eats most of the man's chest. He then burns the man's body and possessions.
Meanwhile, Sarah begins seeing another man named David. Late one night after a date, someone rings her doorbell, but she sees no one. Mark attacks her with chloroform and brings her back inside her apartment to look at her one last time. Mark continues on his hunting spree as his appearance slowly becomes more ghastly and his behavior more erratic. He begins losing a lot of weight and becomes weaker. His leg breaks during the disposal of a victim's body, and he is forced to attach a metal rod to support his ankle. Mark also begins to lose his grip on reality and suffers from hallucinations. His decomposition becomes so severe that he can no longer bear to look at himself, so he overdoses with a bottle of chloroform.

The film took four years to make.  It was shot and edited in 18 months, but it took another 18 months after director Andrew Parkinson realized that there were problems with the script's structure.  The unplanned re-shoots caused strained relationships, but the film was completed.  Post production took another six months.  Parkinson likes the grain, texture, and colors of 16 mm film, and wanted to use that in his film.  Broke at the time that he made ''I, Zombie'', Parkinson was unable to pay even traveling expenses.  He did not use auditions, as he had either worked with the actors previously or had seen them in local theater.  Giles Aspen performed his own stunts.
Fangoria Films released ''I, Zombie'' in 1998.  It was released on VHS in 1999.
Jinga Films released ''I, Zombie'' on DVD in North American on 18 February 2014.
Keith Phipps of ''The A.V. Club'' wrote that the film is too dull to appeal even to ''Fangoria'' subscribers.
Marc Price, the director of ''Colin'', said that if he had known about the existence of ''I, Zombie'', he probably wouldn't have made his film.

'''''Deathdream''''' (also known as '''''Dead of Night''''') is a 1974 Canadian horror film directed by Bob Clark and written by Alan Ormsby. Filmed in Brooksville, Florida, it was inspired by the W.W. Jacobs short story "The Monkey's Paw".
In Vietnam, US soldier Andy Brooks is shot by a sniper and falls to the ground. As he dies, he hears his mother's voice calling out, "Andy, you'll come back. You've got to. You promised." The voice becomes sinister and muffled as Andy's eyes close. Sometime later, his family receives notice of his death in combat.
Back home, Andy's father, Charles, and sister, Cathy, begin to grieve, but his mother, Christine, becomes irate and refuses to believe that Andy has died. Hours later, in the middle of the night, Andy arrives at the front door in full uniform and apparently unharmed; the family accepts the notice of his death as a clerical error and welcomes him back with joy.
Over the next few days, Andy displays strange and erratic behavior, dressing in an unusually concealing manner and spending his days sitting around the house listless and anemic. Meanwhile, local police investigate the murder of a local trucker, who was found with his throat slashed and his body drained of blood after telling diner patrons that he'd picked up a hitchhiking soldier.
Charles attempts to confront Christine about Andy's erratic behavior, which causes tension between the couple. Christine insists that Charles was too withdrawn and authoritarian toward Andy; Charles counters that Christine made Andy too sensitive by smothering him. Andy continues to display unusual behavior: he attacks a neighborhood boy who attempts to demonstrate his karate skills, then attacks the family dog when it tries to protect the child. At night, Andy becomes inexplicably lively and animated, wandering the town and spending time in the local cemetery. It ultimately becomes apparent that Andy has returned as some kind of vampire or zombie, and as a result, has been using syringes to inject the blood of others into his decaying body to reinvigorate himself.
On a double date at the drive-in with his high school sweetheart, Joanne, his sister and his best friend, Andy begins to decay due to lack of blood. He attacks and kills Joanne and his friend. The other drive-in patrons witness the attack and panic. Andy flees before he can inject his victims' blood. The police pursue Andy, and the chase ends at the graveyard where Andy had been spending his free time. They discover Andy's decayed corpse in a shallow grave beneath a crudely fashioned tombstone. Christine, looking at her son's body, tells the police, "Andy's home. Some boys never come home."

Filming took place in Brooksville, Florida.
''Deathdream'' was shown in Tampa, Florida on August 30, 1974.
Blue Underground DVD released a special edition of ''Deathdream'' in 2004. Special features include an audio commentary by Bob Clark, an audio commentary by Alan Ormsby, the featurette ''Tom Savini: The Early Years'', the featurette ''Deathdreaming: Interview with star Richard Backus'', alternate opening titles, extended ending sequence, trailers, and a poster & still gallery.
Glenn Erickson of ''DVD Talk'' wrote, "The reason ''Deathdream'' works is its superior dramatic staging. The actors are excellent, especially John Marley and Lynn Carlin, both honored for their roles in John Cassavetes' ''Faces''. Clark stages the domestic scenes with a fine simplicity and what we remember the most is the looks of bewilderment on nicely-framed faces."
Paul Corupe of ''DVD Verdict'' wrote, "''Deathdream'', the second collaboration by director Bob Clark and screenwriter Alan Ormsby, is a marked artistic and technical leap forward from the pair's overrated debut feature, ''Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things''. A modern spin on the classic "be careful what you wish for" theme, Ormsby's screenplay balances a pointed Vietnam War allegory with pulpier aspects-a "shock" ending, distinct moments of morbid comic relief and beyond-the-grave retribution ripped from the pages of a 1950s horror comic."
In ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle wrote, "Though not very lively and ultimately anti-climactic, the movie sustains a calculated mood of off-centered awkwardness from to finish, and is buttressed by strong acting and plausible dialogue."
Glenn Kay wrote in ''Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide'' that ''Deathdream'' is "one of [Clark's] creepiest and most thought-provoking works".

'''''Zombie Holocaust''''', (Original title: '''''Zombi Holocaust''''') also known as '''''Zombie 3''''' and '''''Doctor Butcher, M.D.''''', is a 1980 Italian zombie film directed by Marino Girolami.
In New York City a hospital worker is found to have been devouring bodies in the morgue. Morgue assistant and anthropology expert Lori (Alexandra Delli Colli) discovers he was from the Asian Molucca islands where she grew up. Dr. Peter Chandler (Ian McCulloch) investigates, and he and Lori discover that similar corpse mutilations have occurred in other city hospitals, where immigrants from this region are working.
Peter leads an expedition to the islands to investigate, where he liaises with Doctor Obrero. Included are his assistant George, George's eager journalist girlfriend Susan, Lori, local boatsman Molotto assigned by Obrero, and three guides. The crew are hunted by cannibals and zombies, the latter created by the sinister Doctor Obrero who is experimenting with corpses.
Lori is accepted as queen of the cannibals, and sends them off against the mad scientist and his zombie army.

Following the success of ''Zombi 2'' (1979) and ''Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals'' (1977), producer Fabrizio De Angelis came up with the idea of cashing in on both films' subjects at the same time. He reused the basic story of ''Zombi 2'' and added elements of cannibal films to come up with ''Zombie Holocaust''. The film depicted zombies and cannibals clashing on a south-east Asian island. The zombies of this film physically resemble those of ''Zombi 2'' but they do not consume flesh, being more in line with the zombies from Haitian folklore. In this film, it is the island native people that hunt, kill, and consume humans.
''Zombi Holocaust'' was re-edited for U.S. release as ''Doctor Butcher, M.D.''  This version contained a 2½ minute sequence from an unfinished American film that was to be called ''Tales That'll Tear  Your Heart Out'', and a different music score. Certain scenes were also re-edited for pacing reasons.  This version also contains a 5 minute sequence presented on Shriek Show's DVD as a deleted scene.  The deleted scene also appears in certain foreign prints, one of which runs 86 minutes.
The DVD was released on May 21, 2002, by Media Blasters#Shriek Show|Shriek Show. It can be purchased separately or in a triple feature package. The Zombie Pack, Vol. 2 contains ''Zombie Holocaust'', ''Burial Ground: The Nights of Terror'', and ''Flesheater''.

'''''The Zombie Diaries''''' is a 2006 British independent horror film written, produced and directed by Kevin Gates and first-time feature-filmmaker Michael Bartlett.
The film was shot in a hand-held documentary format on DV and split into three separate parts.
Soldiers of the British army clear a small collection of farmhouses with two scientists who take a tissue sample from a deceased civilian who appears to have been reanimated, then shot.
The film's first chapter, "The Outbreak", begins in the city of London, emphasizing both the dismissive and paranoid reactions of the population to an unspecified disease outbreak that is gradually making its way to Britain. The film then moves to footage of a documentary crew's travel to the countryside, where, in the process of filming material related to the virus, the characters encounter the zombie outbreak firsthand.  The story of these four individuals is revisited in the second half of the movie.
The second chapter, "The Scavengers", takes place one month later.  Two men (one of whom is American) and one woman travel around in a small car armed only with a rifle, in search of food and radio parts.
The final chapter, "The Survivors", tells the story of a larger group of uninfected people who have set up camp on a farm.  They divide their time doing reconnaissance of surrounding areas, holding off the endless stream of incoming zombies, and bickering amongst themselves.  In the opening scene of the chapter, the audience watches as "the survivors" calmly execute the approaching infected.  By the conclusion, in which the film goes back in time to the first nights of the documentary crew at the beginning of the first diary ("The Outbreak"), the word "survivors" becomes an ironic title, as all but one are killed by two uninfected psychopaths.
Both of the murderers also survive, one having disappeared after helping slaughter the film crew and the other kills off the "survivors".
Whilst the cast was made up of professional actors, few were well-known other than a brief appearance from Leonard Fenton, best known for playing Dr. Harold Legg in ''EastEnders''.
The principal cast consisted of:
* Russell Jones - Goke
* Craig Stovin - Andy
* Jonnie Hurn - John
* James Fisher - Geoff
* Anna Blades - Vanessa
* Imogen Church - Sue
* Sophia Ellis - Anna McKenzie
* Victoria Summer - Leeann
* Jessica Gannon - Creature
* Jonathan Ball (actor) - Matt
* Alison Mollon - Elizabeth
* Kyle Sparks - Greg
* Will Tosh - James
* Eve Appley - Young Girl
* Vicky Appley - Mother
The idea for the film was proposed by Michael Bartlett to Kevin Gates in Autumn 2004. Bartlett originally envisaged it as a short film, but Gates felt it was better suited to feature film length.
Casting involved asking actors to improvise entire sequences from the film. Gates and Bartlett picked the largely unknown cast as a result of this process. Shooting took place at weekends between July and November 2005 and post-production was completed during 2006.
The film made a small-scale cinema debut on 29 October 2006 at Letchworth Garden City's Broadway Cinema, followed by a debut in Leicester Square on 27 August 2007, as part of the UK's biggest horror film festival London FrightFest Film Festival (this showing was preceded by an attempt to break the world record for participants in a zombie walk).
The US DVD was released on 18 November 2008 by Dimension Films.
Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, "Though ''The Zombie Diaries'' doesn't exactly break any new ground, it does provide viewers with an extremely visceral and at times bleak experience."  Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic Peter Dendle wrote, "If the zombies themselves aren't brilliant, they inhabit a truly effective zombie movie and a convincing undead apocalypse." Anton Bitel of  gave the film three out of five stars and remarked that "despite some unexpected connecting links that emerge between its three fragmented 'diaries', the overall film suffers from a lack of cohesion and economy."http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/the-zombie-diaries-film-review-by-anton-bitel
In March 2010, it was announced by the film's producer, writer and director Michael Bartlett that he and his co-producer, writer and director Kevin Gates had come up with an idea to make a sequel to the film. It was also announced that the sequel had been approved by The Weinstein Company and that Bartlett and Gates will be returning to direct and a few of the cast members from the first film will be returning to star.
The sequel received a limited UK cinema release on 24 June 2011, followed by a DVD released on 27 June. A US release followed in October. The leads are played by Alix Wilton Regan (replacing Victoria Summer as Leeann), Philip Brodie and Vicky Aracio.

'''''The Stink of Flesh''''' is a 2005 black comedy and sexploitation film directed by Scott Phillips, which depicts a band of survivors in a zombie wasteland.
The movie begins as a sexually insatiable woman named Dexy implores her husband Nathan to find her "someone to play with," implying a polyamorous relationship.  Immediately afterward, a man armed with a one-handed sledgehammer and a number of long spikes is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, which he ultimately kills by overpowering it and driving a spike into its head with his hammer.  His name is revealed to be 'Matool', a reference to the movie ''Zombi 2'', as he has the same name as the island in the movie.  He then sees another zombie approaching him, which appears to annoy him more than frighten him.  He is also shown being extremely protective of his glasses, since zombies have overrun the world and he might find it difficult to acquire another pair.
As the opening credits roll, short clips are shown of Matool running around the deserted streets of Albuquerque, New Mexico, while Nathan is driving his pickup on those same streets, showing that the city is devoid of human life.
Afterward, a young woman is shown trapped in her car by a group of ravenous zombies outside, while her male companion is pulled down and devoured.  Matool hears this and utters "Fuck yeah!" while rushing off to her rescue.  Though she is obviously reluctant, she allows herself to be saved, but Matool is forced to resort to carrying her, as she is overcome by panic.  They take refuge in a rundown, abandoned house, which is already occupied by a middle-aged man and two young boys.  The older man, Mr. Rainville, seems not to be bothered much by what is happening outside, and neither does one of his young friends, but the other boy does not speak at all or show any kind of emotion.  After some amusing introductions, Matool inquires as to the identity of the man who was just killed, and the young woman replies that it was her brother, much to Matool's joy, but she is incensed by his subtle advances, and still believes that they can save her now-dead brother.  Rainville continues to do nothing but sit and watch as all this happens, though he does not hesitate to jump in with a witty comment about he's "not going to fuck you either" to Matool, mocking his attempts to get the young lady in bed.  The woman then loses it and tries to leave to save her brother, but is pulled down and devoured by several zombies while Matool has no choice but to run.  Rainville and one of the boys are eaten alive, but the quiet one simply hides, showing no emotion whatsoever.
As Matool runs, Nathan hits him with the door of his truck.  Matool later wakes up bound in the back of Nathan's truck as they arrive at Nathan's house in the mountains near the city. Also in the truck is the quiet boy who Rainville had taken in (though the purposes for which he did so are implied to be carnal in nature).  After being taken inside, he is cut loose, welcomed, allowed to bathe, and is bluntly informed that Nathan and Dexy have an alternative lifestyle, which involves Nathan watching while other men engage in sexual activity with Dexy.  Matool is intrigued by this and goes along with the idea, but their first time, Dexy's sister Sassy smacks his bare rear with a ruler, surprising Matool, who is even more surprised when he sees that this new woman has a mutated human face on her side, the result of some kind of conjoined twins situation (the face appears to be self-aware, and is named Dottie).  Matool apologizes for freaking out, seeing that Sassy is very sensitive.
After a few days, during which Matool gets used to his new surroundings, and after a few fights with zombies lurking outside, Nathan and Matool become fast friends, and Matool is shown a shed behind the house where Nathan keeps a naked female zombie that he likes to "look at", prompting Matool to remark "Yeah, she'd be pretty fucking hot if she weren't decomposing."
Shortly thereafter, a small group of soldiers arrive in the rain.  Two are carrying a third, who is badly injured.  Their leader is Mandel, the other is Vega, and the wounded man is Sepulveda, who talk their way inside.  A flashback reveals that they were part of a larger unit surviving on the roads after the zombies overran civilization until a zombie attack (including what they call 'hyperzombies, which can move faster than normal zombies) cost them two soldiers (one, a male, was eaten alive and another, a female, was dragged screaming under their truck), and wounded Sepulveda.  Mandel becomes acquainted with Matool who tells him that the house is well-supplied, has power from an electrical generator, a well, as well as "more".  Sepulveda is placed in an unoccupied bedroom where Mandel and Vega take turns watching him, knowing that death and reanimation are inevitable.  Also, Vega becomes acquainted with Sassy, who later admits to Mandel and Matool that the face on her side is "disturbingly sexy" (prompting Matool to call him "disturbingly weird").
Later, Mandel and Vega begin having sex with Dexy while Nathan watches, causing him obvious frustration, leading him to, while the others are having breakfast, sneak back to his shed and have rough sex with his chained female zombie.  A flashback reveals that the female zombie was one of two survivors who had arrived sometime earlier (the other being a male), who, after seeing Dexy's attraction to them both, shot the man and strangled the woman, keeping her for sexual purposes.
As the days pass, Vega and Sassy begin a relationship, while Sepulveda continues to die in agony, while Mandel resists Matool's suggestion that he be put down right away.  Nathan and Matool continue to fight and destroy zombies (Nathan with a Beretta pistol, Matool with his trademark hammer and spikes) as they show up at the house.
Things inevitably fall apart, however, as the quiet boy who has not yet said a word begins feeling an attraction towards Dexy, and takes Nathan's keys and frees his female zombie, leaving it contained in the shed.  Meanwhile, Sepulveda wakes up and sees Sassy for the first time, as well as her conjoined twin, freaking out at how disgusting it is, causing Sassy to lose it and kill him with a pair of scissors.  Mandel, who was watching Sepulveda, instinctively shoots Sassy, killing her.  Nathan goes out to the shed for a tryst, but is killed and devoured by his zombie companion.  Meanwhile, Matool, Mandel, and Vega take Sassy and Sepulveda's bodies out before they reanimate as zombies, while attempting to reassure Dexy that it was "an accident".  Matool smashes Sassy's head with a cinder block over Vega's objections who is then attacked and killed by a reanimated Sepulveda.
As more zombies begin to gather at the house, Matool demands that Mandel go back into the house to get his MP5 submachine gun, but he can't, as the boy has locked them out.  Mandel then kills the Sepulveda zombie with his knife.  Then they head to the shed to find Nathan.  They open the door and see him being devoured by his female zombie and proceed to lock her back in.  As more and more zombies arrive, Mandel punches Matool, claiming Dexy as his own, but Matool fights back.  As they fight, they find themselves surrounded and are forced to run down the same road to escape.  Dexy, meanwhile, looks out the window as the zombies approach the door while the boy comes up to her, still not speaking or expressing any emotion.  She looks at him and says "Nathan will be back."  The boy then holds Dexy's hand.
The movie ends with Matool and Mandel running down a gravel road together, making their escape.
The DVD includes a 46-minute film detailing the adventures of the cast and crew over the twelve days of shooting.
Seven minutes of especially funny outtakes are featured.
There is also a ten-minute film showing the premier of ''The Stink of Flesh'' at the Guild Theater in Albuquerque, where many independent movies, especially those made in and around Albuquerque, are shown.
Also featured is a short called "Rainville, the Early Years" in which Bob Vardeman, who played Rainville, essentially goes on a random, foul-mouthed rampage while driving, walking around his front yard, petting his cat, and trying on hats for the movie.
The character of Sassy was played by Kristin Hansen,the niece of Gunnar Hansen, who played Leatherface in the original ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''.
Kurly Tlapoyawa (Matool) and Billy Garberina (Mandel) are both accomplished martial artists who did their own stunts and choreographed many of the film's fight scenes.
The film served as a springboard for actor Kurly Tlapoyawa's career as a stunt performer. After Crank directors Mark Neveldine and Bryan Taylor saw The Stink of Flesh while filming ''Gamer (film)'' in Albuquerque, they brought Tlapoyawa on to the film as a stuntman (Tlapoyawa is one of the slayers who fight Gerard Butler in the film's climax). Tlapoyawa also performed stunts for the duo on ''Crank 2: High Voltage''.
The military truck shown in the movie was borrowed from a friend of one of the crew.
While filming the scenes in which Matool is hiding in the abandoned house with Rainville and the girl, a deputy from the Bernalillo Country Sheriff's Department arrived, responding to reports of a woman screaming, called in by passing motorists.
Referenced in ''Necroville,'' also shot in Albuquerque, with Billy Garberina in the lead role.  At the beginning of the movie, Garberina's character, while working as a video store clerk, is causally reading a newspaper article showing a still shot from the end of ''The Stink of Flesh,'' the article explaining that a soldier and carpenter have a story to tell about their experiences of debauchery.  In ''Necroville,'' zombies (as well as werewolves and vampires) stalk the streets of the town, but are regarded as pests more than anything else, while businesses and private citizens hire a company of exterminators to deal with them.

'''''Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane''''' is a 2007 direct-to-video zombie film by director Scott Thomas playing off the concept of the 2006 film ''Snakes on a Plane''. Thomas co-wrote the screenplay with Mark Onspaugh and Sidney Iwanter. The film was originally titled '''''Plane Dead''''', but the title was changed at Montreal's 2007 Fantasia Festival screening. In spite of a successful screening there and at other festivals, the film did not gain a commercial release and was issued directly to DVD in unrated form.
On a routine flight from Los Angeles to Paris, a wikt:renegade|renegade group of scientists has smuggled aboard a secret container holding a fellow scientist infected with a deadly genetically engineered virus which reanimates the dead. The virus is said to be a variant of the  "malaria virus." They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon.  Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable. One survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine.
The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases one of the scientists from the cargo hold.  Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, and are also killed, starting a zombie outbreak. The uninfected passengers must fight for survival aboard the flight. No government will allow the infected airliner to land, leaving the survivors stranded in the sky with their ravenous tormentors. Billy, his wife Anna, Burrows, Frank, Paul, and Megan, a stewardess aboard the plane, are all that are left of the uninfected people. They must make their way to the cockpit and signal a fighter jet behind them that there are still living people aboard the 747 or the fighter will destroy them. After managing to get a MP5K machine gun from a dead guard, Burrows, Frank and Billy make their way from the tail of the plane to the cockpit, while the couple stay behind. Billy is bitten but manages to kill some of the undead passengers, while Anna comes to help Billy she gets bitten but kills the Undead by thrusting an umbrella into its mouth. After that they both get surrounded, Billy opens the emergency exit and most of the infected get sucked out.
Frank and Burrows make it to the cockpit where Frank kills the zombie copilot and pilot, and the two of them try to get the plane off autopilot and signal the fighter which fires at them. They are ultimately successful and waggle the plane's wings, alerting the fighter. The fighter pilot hits the abort key and the missile explodes away from the 747, but close enough to the plane to open a hole in the side. All the zombies are apparently sucked out. Frank and Burrows try to control the plane, but hit a mountain and crash land near Las Vegas, Nevada.
As the survivors walk toward the city, apparently some of the zombies also survived the crash, and they lurch toward the city as well.

'''''Dead Heat''''' is a 1988 American action comedy horror film directed by Mark Goldblatt and starring Treat Williams, Joe Piscopo and Vincent Price. The B movie is about an LAPD police officer who is murdered while attempting to arrest zombies who have been reanimated by the head of Dante Laboratories in order to carry out violent armed robberies, and decides to get revenge with the help of his former partner.
Detectives Roger Mortis (Treat Williams) and Doug Bigelow (Joe Piscopo) are called to the scene of a rather violent jewelry store robbery. The robbers take on a squadron of police in a messy shootout, but neither seem affected when they are riddled with bullets. Thanks to the combined, albeit extreme measures of Mortis and Bigelow, they are able to take out the criminals, their acts narrowly avoiding termination. Meanwhile, a coroner friend of Roger's, Rebecca (Clare Kirkconnell) informs the detectives that the two bodies they had brought in had previously been to the morgue: not only do they have autopsy scars, but she herself clearly remembers performing the autopsy and has pictures to prove it, suggesting they simply got up and left the morgue at their own volition.
There is a preservative chemical compound found in the bodies that connect the pair of detectives to a company that had ordered a great amount of it recently. Mortis and Bigelow investigate and meet the company's head public relations person, Randi James (Lindsay Frost) who gives them a tour of the facility. When Doug wanders off to investigate a suspicious room, he encounters the reanimated corpse of a biker on a strange machine and in the fray, Roger is knocked into a decompression room used to humanely kill failed test animals and is asphyxiated to death.
Encountering the machine, and realizing it is capable of bringing people back from the dead, Rebecca and Doug successfully bring Roger back from the dead. He says he feels fine, yet he has no heart beat and his skin is cold to the touch, Rebecca surmises he has about twelve hours before the reanimation process ends and he dissolves into a puddle of mush. Roger decides to take this time to find and exact his vengeance on the person who killed him. They go to Randi's house just shortly before she is attacked by two more undead thugs, which the partners are able to subdue. Randi says that she is the daughter of a rich industrialist, and the owner of the company she works for until his death, Arthur P. Laudermilk (Vincent Price).
The two of them pay another visit to Rebecca, who says that she might have found a way to keep Roger in healthy condition indefinitely, but the unsure nature of the theory has him decide to spend his final hours finding the man who killed him. He and Randi pay a visit to Laudermilk's tomb and Randi admits she's not his daughter, more a protégé or daughter he'd never had. While there, they encounter a numeric code, which Roger discovers later is a vital clue. Upon returning to Randi's home, they find Doug dead, having been suspended and drowned in a fish tank for some time. Randi tells Roger that she too is undead, having been one of Laudermilk's first test subjects for resurrection, shortly before abruptly dissolving while asking for Roger's forgiveness.
Roger confronts the head coroner Dr. Ernest McNab (Darren McGavin) who was indicated by the secret numeric code that Roger had found, but he turns the tables on Roger, capturing him, then locking him in an ambulance with Rebecca's dead body in order to wait out his last hour to dissolution. He releases the brakes on the ambulance and puts it in neutral, sending it careening down the highway into a massive collision, from which he emerges, even more zombified and scarred almost beyond recognition. He returns to the hospital where McNab and a resurrected Laudermilk are pitching the resurrection machine to a group of very rich clients. Mortis breaks in and the ensuing crossfire between him and McNab's men kill off most of the rich clients, leaving Laudermilk cowering in a corner.
McNab reveals a test subject; Doug, resurrected from the machine. But because he's been dead for hours, the brain deterioration leaves him little more than an obedient zombie with no memory of who Roger is. Before he can obey McNab's orders to kill Mortis however, Roger manages to trigger Doug's short term memory and bring him back to normal. The pair go after McNab who immediately kills himself before they can do anything. Roger and Doug put McNab onto the resurrection table and resurrect him, but Doug starts the resurrection process again and it overloads, causing a screaming McNab to explode in the machine. Despite Laudermilk's pleas and promises of eternal life, the pair then destroy the machine completely, leaving the room pondering about the afterlife and reincarnation; Doug's fond wish of being reincarnated as a girl's bicycle seat intriguing the both of them. Roger says finally, "This could be the end of a beautiful friendship."

'''''City of Rott''''' is a 2006 animated zombie film by Frank Sudol, who performed all filmmaking duties himself. The film uses 2D limited animation in a style similar to ''South Park''. A sequel, ''City of Rott 2'', was released in October 2014 through Amazon.com.
The story begins after the Earth's water supply has been infected by a strange parasite known as Rot Worms. Rot Worm eggs were delivered by rain, and there's no place on the planet that is free from the worms. Once hatched, they begin feasting on human flesh, turning their hosts into mindless zombies.
The film revolves around Fred, an elderly man with a walker, which he uses as a weapon. Fred appears to be losing his mind, believing his walker speaks to him as he travels through an infested city on a quest for a new pair of shoes.
While searching a mall for the shoes, Fred encounters a recently bitten nurse. With no knowledge of a cure for the infection, the nurse quickly becomes a zombie, forcing Fred to flee the mall. Outside, he meets Jon, a skilled shooter who decides to help Fred escape the city. However, Fred loses his walker in an ensuing scuffle with zombies, where it gets taken from him by the nurse. Unwilling to abandon his closest friend (even as his slippers assume the role of inanimate speaking object), Fred abandons Jon by stealing a motorcycle.
The motorcycle runs out of gas on a bridge, leading Fred to be surrounded on both sides by zombies. Fortunately, he manages to recover his walker from the nurse and kill numerous zombies, though he is unable to finish off the nurse herself. After fighting his way through the hoard of undead, Fred rescues another survivor, an old man carrying a bottle of prune juice. However, the man flees from Fred.
Deciding to rest on a park bench, Fred discovers a newspaper detailing a new type of parasite known as Brain Worms, which eat any intake of food and eventually eat the brain of their host. As becomes evident from the symptoms of partial memory loss, rapid age progression, hallucinations, and hearing voices, Fred has already been infected by one. Unfortunately, the blood which got on him during the fight on the bridge contains Rot Worms, which quickly overpower the lesser Brain Worms, turning him into a zombie.
The next day, Jon, who was unknowingly infected with a Brain Worm when Fred patted him on the back, discovers the now infected Fred. Jon attempts to kill him, but is surrounded and eaten by the zombies.
Eight days later, a man named Benjamin has begun to look for his wife in the city with his two sons and another man named Larry, the four using a van to store goods. While Benjamin has one of his sons pick up doughnuts, Larry gets attacked by the undead, then accidentally shot by the other son. Afterwards, it is revealed that the nurse was Benjamin's wife and she left the group in an attempt to help others. Benjamin tries to bring her back despite her infection, but is attacked and killed, while another zombie decapitates his wife.
A man named Hac is sent by his bitten friend Mac to find an antidote. Mac has begun to believe that the old man carries the cure in his bottle of prune juice. Though both Hac and Mac die before learning the truth, Mac's belief turns out to be correct. The bottle carries an antidote known as "Zombifate", which the old man constantly consumes. Fred catches up to the old man, who orders him to resist the worms' influence. Fred manages to temporarily overcome the infection and save the old man from zombies, but the man dies of a sudden heart attack. Fred tries to cure himself with Zombifate, but worm inside him refuses to accept the medicine. Then Fred begins to feast on old man's corpse consuming so much flesh that the Zombifate inside the old man's body forces the Rot Worms out of him, allowing Fred to ultimately cure himself and get to some safer position (outright stated in City of Rott 2 preview).
After the film's credits, a man who trapped himself inside a box laughs about surviving the zombies, but has been infected by a Brain Worm.''The New York Times''  at Allmovie 2005

Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 5/5 stars and described it as "blood-splattered blast from beginning to end that's heavy on the sick".  Scot Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote that it has a "fun concept, clever execution, unique animation, and tons of gooey gore".

'''''Vampires vs. Zombies''''' is an independent horror film loosely based upon J. Sheridan Le Fanu's classic 1872 novel ''Carmilla''. Unlike Le Fanu's story, however, most of the action in the film takes place inside a car. The title and the cover were obviously inspired by the horror film ''Freddy vs. Jason'', it's unclear if it was intended as a mockbuster of that film or not.   
The movie was originally titled ''Vampires vs. Zombies'', but it has since then been changed to '''Carmilla, the Lesbian Vampire'''. Vince D'Amato is the director and screenwriter of this film. 
The movie begins with a scene showing a sleeping girl being menaced by a female vampire in her bedroom. The dream is abandoned when the sleeping girl wakes up screaming in the front seat of her father's forest green Jeep Cherokee. She then tells her father that she has had "the same dream again".
Jenny and her father, Travis, who is at the helm of said forest green Jeep Cherokee, are driving at a steady 5 miles per hour, to an undisclosed location. Suddenly there is an incident. Jenny yells out "DAD!" as the jeep proceeds to plow over a zombie dressed up like a roadside construction worker. The zombie's head goes flying skyward immediately following the impact, though its body still shows a head visibly attached. The audience is then treated to a techno rave ballad as the jeep fades from view, and the beginning credits roll.
A radio news reporter describes a recent and horrific epidemic of zombiedom that has swept the calm countryside of the once peaceful set of woods with one road and a gas station. The reports indicate that a symptom of said outbreak is "murder". They then pull up beside a stalled car with three occupants: an older woman and two younger women- one of whom is bound and gagged. Ignoring the bound and gagged girl, Travis gives the other girl a lift. This girl is possibly a vampire named Carmilla, or possibly not. This is followed by a very long sequence at a roadside gas-station in which a strange woman in gothic make-up (possibly a witch or sorceress) hands them a necklace.
As the gas-station attendant (played by producer Rob Carpenter) gets sucked into an orgy of violence at the hands of vampires/zombies, Travis, his daughter Jenny, and Carmilla drive off, only to break down further down the road. They are stranded for hours until a guy in a Land Rover drives up. As the driver is turning into a vampire, Travis kills him and uses some of his supplies to fix the jeep. He lets Jenny and Carmilla steal the Land Rover. As Travis drives ahead in the jeep, Carmilla and Jenny indulge in lesbian sex in the commandeered Land Rover. The destination is the original crypt Carmilla had been buried in. Flashbacks of a madhouse emerge, where Carmilla is revealed to be a nurse, and Jenny her insane patient. Later, they make their way to the crypt, where they encounter more zombies/vampires. After the true reality of the situation is revealed, they check into a motel. Bright-red stage blood flows in these gory and surreal scenes, which could be delusional or possibly flash-backs. There is also a vampire-hunter known as 'The General' who may be pursuing them, or possibly, arranging a rendezvous, due to his daughter being kidnapped by a female colleague of Carmilla.
The film ends with a spinning book and the words, '''''The End.'''''
* According to 'Dr Gore' the film demonstrates "Grade-Z incompetence". He gives it a "Landfill" rating.
* 'Wooden Spoon' describes the film's script as "abominable" and opines that it is "worse than ''Troll 2''".
* 'Movie House Commentary' reflects that "the actors deliver their lines with the unnatural inflections of small-time appliance store owners doing their own local TV commercials".
* According to Something Awful's Movie Review, director "Vince D'Amato took a premise that was basically guaranteed to make his movie an instant hit with the indie horror crowd in spite of his nonexistent budget, and he fucked it until it bled. The resulting wretched, scarred, abused, tortured rape victim of a movie is an unwatchable seventy minutes of shattered homes and broken dreams."
* Some reviews of the film are positive: Horror Express stated that "what we have is a film that purports to be based on Sheridan Le Fanu's short story, 'Carmilla.' I've read that story more than once, and although this is a loose adaptation, it's more faithful than some other filmmakers who adapted Le Fanu's work, seemingly without reading it."

'''''Zeder''''' (aka ''Revenge of the Dead'') is a 1983 Italian horror film directed by Pupi Avati, starring Gabriele Lavia. The story is about a young novelist's discovery of the writings of a late scientist who had found a means of reviving the dead. 
In 1956, Gabriella (Veronica Moriconi)-a girl with apparent psychic powers-is brought to the enormous house of Dr. Meyer (Cesare Barbetti) in Chartres, France. Meyer intends to conduct an experiment testing her abilities. He takes her into his basement, where the youngster abruptly falls to her knees and begins digging into the dirt. "This is where you're hiding, isn't it?" Meyer yells. He rushes upstairs for help from his assistants and leaves Gabriella by herself. She is attacked by something unseen and is taken to the hospital. In the basement, further digging reveals a rotted corpse, with a nearby wallet identifying the dead man as Paolo Zeder. Dr. Meyer realizes that the earth in which Zeder was buried was a 'K-Zone'.
In present day Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old typewriter as a birthday present by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the typewriter's ribbon. As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zones-areas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead. 
Stefano investigates the message left on the typewriter ribbon. He encounters people who make it clear that they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences. A nearby service station attendant tells Stefano that French investors are building a gigantic hotel on the property, but no work is ever seen being done. 
Stefano sneaks onto the property, and discovers surveillance equipment with numerous monitors showing the dead face of a man buried in a coffin. Stefano watches the monitors. The dead man is Don Luigi Costa, an ex-priest who abandoned his vows after contracting an incurable disease. Continuing Zeder's work, Costa had himself buried on the property, a suspected K-Zone, and his rebirth from the dead is caught on camera. Stefano manages to elude the conspirators involved in the experimental work, but finds his wife has been murdered by them. At night, Stefano buries her in a K-Zone located on the abandoned property. She revives and approaches her husband. In the darkness, Stefano begins screaming horribly.

'''''Let Sleeping Corpses Lie''''' ( is a 1974 Spanish-Italian science fiction horror film written and directed by Jorge Grau and starring Ray Lovelock, Arthur Kennedy and Cristina Galbó. The film focuses on two protagonists who are harassed by a local police investigator in the English countryside and are implicated in murders committed by zombies who have been brought to life by a farming tool designed to kill insects via ultra-sonic radiation.
After being presented at the Sitges Film festival in Spain on September 30, 1974, the film was released in Italy on November 28, 1974 and was later released throughout 1975 in the United States and the United Kingdom under varying titles. In total, the film was released under more than 15 different titles internationally.
George (Ray Lovelock) is taking a trip from his antique shop in Manchester to the Lake District to work on a new house with some of his friends. On the way, his Norton motorcycle is accidentally damaged by Edna (Cristina Galbó) while reversing her Mini Cooper at a petrol station. He demands she give him a lift to his destination, while Edna, on her way to visit her troubled sister, asks to go to the town of Southgate first, and to let George take her car to Windermere where she will later retrieve it.
George agrees, but the two come to a dead end road alongside a river while searching for Edna's sister's house. George crosses the river on foot to a farm where several men from the Department of Agriculture are using an experimental machine in a field. While asking for directions, he inquires about their machinery, which they explain is designed to kill insects through ultra-sonic radiation. Meanwhile, while Edna waits at the car, she is attacked by a man who emerges from the river, but he disappears after she reaches George.
Night falls, and Edna's drug addict sister, Katie West (Jeannine Mestre), is getting into argument with her photographer husband, Martin (Jóse Lifante) about her sister's impending arrival. Martin goes down to a waterfall near their remote cottage to take photographs, and Katie is attacked by the same man whom Edna had encountered earlier. Katie runs to the waterfall to get Martin, where the man kills him. Katie frantically runs up the hill back to the cottage, where Edna and George have just arrived.
When the three report the death, the aggressive police sergeant thinks that Katie did it. George, forced to stay in South Gate, secretly takes the roll of film from Martin's camera to a local chemist to have it developed. Meanwhile, they book into the Old Owl Hotel. Katie has a breakdown and is hospitalised. At the hospital, it turns out that babies are affected too, biting people with homicidal intensity.
Back at the chemist's, they collect the photos, but the dead man does not appear in any of the pictures; the man, it turns out, is a local vagrant who drowned in the river. The sergeant arrives and takes photos and, when the couple leaves, sends one of his officers, PC Craig (Giorgio Trestini), to trail them, but he loses them. They go to the graveyard and in a room in the chapel find a half-eaten meal. Following noises to a crypt, they come across a murdered man and are locked in by the vagrant zombie, who brings the other bodies to life by touching their eyes with his blood-stained fingers.
The pair manages to make a hole they can escape from and Edna does, only to find herself in a pit while the zombies have hold of George's feet. Meanwhile, PC Craig turns up and helps Edna out of the pit. George manages to get free and follows them, with the zombies chasing all three of them. They lock themselves in a room but are trapped there, and Craig soon finds that his gun is of no use against the zombies. He makes a dash for the police radio he has dropped outside but is caught by the zombies who tear his chest apart and eviscerate him, and begin eating his organs.
The dead break into their room and in desperation George throws a lit oil lamp at them. It smashes and the zombies quickly burst into flame. The two escape to their car and Edna is sent off to tell the police. George plans to use the unmarked police car to go and smash the machine but it has no key so he runs off. At the machine, the farmer and two machine men do not believe George and reveal that the machine is now working up to a five miles radius. They try to stop him, but he smashes the machine and they drive off to get away from "the mad man".
The sergeant has found Craig and the caretaker's bodies, and thinking they may be devil worshippers, issues orders "to shoot to kill" George and Edna. He is then told that George has deliberately wrecked the machine. Edna has arrived at her brother-in-law's farm only to be met by Martin, who is now a zombie, but she manages to run over him as she escapes. George finds her, drops her off at a petrol station and drives off with a large can of petrol. George is caught in a police trap and Martin's body is taken back to the hospital.
In a field, the machine is repaired and switched on again, which brings to life a number of bodies in the nearby morgue. George escapes in a police car and finds Edna has been taken to the hospital, where the local morgue is. She is being sedated while George is now being chased by the police as he drives to the hospital where the zombies are now killing people, including Katie who as a zombie tries to kill her sister.
George arrives and starts setting fire to zombies but it turns out that he was too late to save Edna and as she suddenly attacks him, he pushes her into a room, which is now burning. George is then shot four times by the over-zealous police sergeant. Everything is over as far as he is concerned now and the sergeant heads to a room at the hotel in South Gate for the night. After shooting him down in cold blood, the sergeant wishes he would come alive again so he could shoot him again. He gets his wish as zombie George is waiting for him in his room, but now bullets won't stop him. In a field nearby, the machine continues working.

The story is set in the English countryside near Windermere, but was primarily filmed in Italy. The scenes featuring the outside of the hospital were shot at Barnes Hospital, Cheadle|Barnes Hospital in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. Some scenes were filmed in the Peak District in Derbyshire, not far from Sheffield. The church scenes were shot in Hathersage, while other scenes were shot in Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton and Dovedale. The opening montage was filmed in Manchester city centre.
The film premiered in Spain on September 30, 1974, in Italy on November 28, 1974, and was released in the United States in 1975 under the title ''Don't Open the Window'', frequenting the drive-in theater|drive-in circuits and cinemas paired as a double feature with ''The Last House on the Left'' (1972).1975 TV advertisement for a double-billing with ''The Last House on the Left'':  The film was released in the United Kingdom under its title ''The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue'', despite the fact that the film takes place in South Gate, not Manchester.
While there are claims that a scene in which a zombie eats an eyeball was filmed, no such scene exists in any surviving print of the film, according to the liner notes of the Blue Underground DVD release. During the scene in which Craig is eaten, the female zombie reaches down toward Craig's eyeball, but before anything happens, a seemingly sloppy edit cuts to a long shot of all the zombies feasting. It is part of the DVD ''Stephen Romano Presents Shock Festival'', which was released on 8 January 2010 in the United States.
According to Edgar Wright, the promotion of the film during its exhibition in the United States was one of the inspirations for the fake trailer ''Don't'', which appears in the 2007 release ''Grindhouse''.
The film was released for the first time on video and DVD in the U.S in 2000 by Anchor Bay Entertainment under the ''Let Sleeping Corpses Lie'' title. The DVD release was available in a standard edition as well as a limited edition collector's tin containing bonus film stills, a booklet of production notes, and a fake toe tag styled after the film. Both editions featured a foreword and extensive interview with director Jorge Grau.
After the Anchor Bay release of the film went out of print, the disc was re-released by Blue Underground in 2005. In 2008, Blue Underground released the film yet again, only this time in a special edition DVD and Blu-ray under the ''Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue'' title.
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 79% of fourteen surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.2/10.

'''''Shatter Dead''''' is a zombie film set in an unknown area following a woman named Susan's (Stark Raven) attempt to return to the apartment of her boyfriend (Daniel 'Smalls' Johnson) in the midst of the return of the dead to a semblance of life. On her way, she is harassed by a preacher (Robert Wells) and a dead woman named Mary (Flora Fauna) intent on convincing her that being undead is preferable to life.
The film opens with a scene of a woman having sex with an apparently female angel. No explanation is given in the film. The back of the DVD cover says the Angel of Death impregnates a mortal woman, causing the dead to come alive. The next shot is of seventeen months later as Susan works her way through a mostly abandoned town on foot. She encounters some of the living dead, including one who gave up his arm to research.
Unlike most modern zombie film denizens, however, they seem somewhat bewildered and eager to please. However, she catches one zombie stealing gas from her car. She chases him and puts a bullet through his gas canister. It explodes dousing the zombie in flames. Susan returns to her car leaves town. Outside of town, her car runs out of gas. She then finds herself surrounded by zombies to force her from her car. A preacher claims her car for the service of the Lord and drives off after the zombies refill the gas tank.
After walking on foot for a while, another car pulls up. The driver offers her a ride. She holds him at gun point and holds a mirror under his nose. When he doesn't exhale warm moist air, she determines him to be a zombie. She takes the car from him (he doesn't put up a fight) and drives for a while, listening to an announcer discussing the current situation on the radio. He doesn't have much information.
Arriving in a new town, she encounters some living people who direct her to a safe house to stay the night (After giving her the mirror test). While staying there, she encounters Mary, a dead woman pretending to be alive, they shower together. Mary tells Susan that she poisoned herself so she can be beautiful forever. Susan, trusts Mary enough to share the bedroom together. Susan sleeps while Mary plays the harmonium. Susan has a dream where she walks in a graveyard and performs fellatio on her sidearm.
At this point the house is attacked by militant zombies (excited by the Preacher who stole Susan's car). This group of Zombies believes these are the end times and God will return once humanity is all dead. They are intent on converting living humans into their way of, uh, metabolism. Waking up surprised, Susan accidentally shoots Mary in the head, destroying Mary's hope of being beautiful forever. The owner of the house, who looks like the woman from the intro but isn't, is shot in the back at close range with a shotgun. She was pregnant but her wound aborts the baby out the front. Susan watches as the newly dead mother begins to nurse the newly dead fetus.
Susan escapes and encounters the preacher who stole her car. She threatens him while he tries to convince her that death is better than life. Susan gives him the mirror test and discovers that he is still alive. Another shot to the face from Susan and the preacher is now one of the undead.
Susan gets her car and her food back and arrives at the apartment of her boyfriend. He's also killed himself but is up and about. The bathtub is filled with his blood. Her boyfriend has lost his mind. He kept hearing the phone ringing and hearing the dead talking to him (including a cremated mother and a sister who never even knew how to use a phone.)
They can't have sex because he has no blood pressure (his blood is in the bathtub after all), so they have intercourse using her gun as a strap-on. He slips poison into her milk. He wants her to be dead and beautiful forever. She tries to induce vomiting, but he stops her. Before she dies, she manages to throw him out the window, breaking most of his bones (and destroying his hope of being young and beautiful forever). The last sequence of the film is a montage switching back and forth between the preacher making splints for her boyfriend and Susan putting tears in her eyes from the faucet so she can mourn her own death.
Director McCrae and cinematographer Howe were inspired to make their own film after watching low-budget exploitation films and thinking that they could make a better one themselves.  After experiencing difficulty in explaining his scripts, McCrae decided to shoot an example of the tone and style that he was attempting to convey; that project became ''Shatter Dead''.  Shooting took a total ten days over a two-month period on weekends.
Joe Bob Briggs gave it a positive review and called it "a Night of the Living Dead for the '90s".
It won the best independent film award at the 1995 Fantafestival.

'''''Beyond Re-Animator''''' is a 2003 Spanish-American Science fiction film|science-fiction horror film directed by Brian Yuzna and starring Jeffrey Combs, Jason Barry, Simón Andreu, Elsa Pataky, and Santiago Segura. It is the third and final installment of the Re-Animator (film series)|''Re-Animator'' film series.
The film premiered on the Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel, though it was produced independently and acquired by the channel only as a distributor; this showing was cut to a TV-PG rating. The subsequently released DVD was rated R, but there is a slightly longer unrated cut available in some countries. It also received a limited theatrical run in the U.S.
For the past 13 years, Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) has been serving a prison sentence due to a murder at the hands of one of his zombies. With what scant supplies he has on hand in the prison medical center, Dr. West has been capable of performing only extremely basic experiments on rats. However, his lack of supplies does not prevent him from uncovering a key element in his re-animation process. Dr. West has discovered "NPE" (Nano-Plasmic Energy), an energy that can be extracted from the brain of a living organism through an electrocution-like process, to be stored in a capsule resembling a small light bulb. The capsule can then be connected to a corpse and used in conjunction with West's previously developed reagent to restore the former dead to a lifelike state. The NPE prevents the degeneration seen in previous instances, where the reanimated are nothing more than mindless zombies. Used together with the re-agent, reanimated corpses regain their skills, memories, and motor functions and nearly fully resemble normal humans.
When a young doctor named Howard Phillips (Jason Barry) comes to work at the prison, West is assigned to assist the new doctor. Due to Phillips' interest with Dr. West's research, West is able to attain the supplies and tools needed to bring his experiments to the next level. It is revealed that Phillips is the younger brother of the teenage girl who was killed by West's zombie (he's shown watching West being taken away by the cops) and came to the prison for the explicit purpose of working with him. Despite his interest, Phillips still maintains an ethical reluctance to allow West's research to full completion. In the meantime, journalist Laura Olney (Elsa Pataky), covering a story for her newspaper at the prison, meets and begins an affair with Dr. Phillips, and they fall in love. This new romance only temporarily postpones West's experiment, however. After the warden of the prison, also infatuated with Laura, attempts to seduce Laura himself, she resists and he angrily kills her.
Crushed by Laura's death, Dr. Phillips succumbs to Dr. West's wishes and his experiments are allowed to literally take on new life. West & Phillips revive Laura with the NPE, although it is quickly seen that the dangerous side effects of West's past work are still present with the NPE. Eventually the warden of the prison uncovers West's experiments and moves to put an end to them, but he is killed by West, and subsequently re-animated. West uses the NPE from a prisoner's pet rat, causing some unexpected side effects in the warden's behavior. It quickly manifests itself as the prison descends into utter chaos as a riot breaks out, with vials of the reagent circulating through the population. Soon, it is unclear who is dead, who is alive, and who has been exposed to the agent. 
When the chaos finally settles from the (very) bloody prison riot, West escapes captivity before the guards appear by stealing Phillips' I.D. (when he comes across Phillips weeping over Laura's decapitated body). As police and authorities take control of the prison, Herbert West is shown putting on his glasses outside the prison, and disappears into the night to continue his research.

In their book ''Lurker in the Lobby: The Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft|Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft'', Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: "If your idea of Lovecraftian fun is Combs' acidic one-liners, and digitally enhanced gore effects that weren't available for the other two films, then by all means have a look. But if you're comparing this film to the still classic ''Re-Animator'', well... This third try is only a shadow of the gonzo wit of the original and not nearly as entertaining."Andrew Migliore & John Strysik, ''Lurker in the Lobby: The Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft|Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft'', Night Shade Books, February 1, 2006, ISBN 978-1892389350
''Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For'' author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that "''Beyond Re-Animator'' is better than its immediate predecessor" and that "Combs slips back into the white shirt and black tie, wielding the hypo of green goo like he never put it down, but his performance is nicely tempered by the passage of time, giving us a West that lacks some of his youthful confidence but none of his single-minded desire to pursue 'The Work.'"

'''''War of the Dead''''' is a 2011 action horror film written and directed by Finnish director Marko Mäkilaakso and starring Andrew Tiernan, Mikko Leppilampi, Jouko Ahola, Samuli Vauramo, Andreas Wilson, Mark Wingett, and Antti Reini.
In a long corridor of an underground bunker, several prisoners are marching under armed guard. As they approach the door at the end of the corridor, one prisoner seizes his chance to assault a guard, but the door opens almost immediately and several German soldiers step through to mow down the entire group, save for one prisoner who remains standing. The guards grab him and force him through the door, where he is placed on an operating table and held down as a drip is inserted into his arm and blood pumped into his veins. He stops moving for a short time before his eyes blink open revealing his irises have become zombified-white.
Some time later, American Captain Martin Stone (Tiernan) is leading a finely-trained, elite platoon of American and Finnish soldiers along with a cameraman and his son as they are sent to attack the bunker, with no knowledge of its secrets. Underestimating their enemy's strength, they are quickly beaten back into the forest. As they try to regroup, they spy a soldier sloping towards them. Identifying him as a threat, they open fire, but as they investigate his corpse it is revealed the soldier is one of their own dead from the previous encounter, and as he springs to life a second time a number of zombies leap into action from their hiding places in the trees to further destroy the unit.
Forced to flee the battle to survive, Stone along with Finns Captain Niemi (Ahola) and Lieutenant Laakso (Leppilampi) as well as the cameraman's son (Wilson) take refuge in a trench, where they encounter lone Russian soldier Kolya (Vauramo), who seems aware of the zombie presence and leads them to a house where they can shelter. They are rapidly split up and attacked, however, with Niemi being bitten and then killing the young cameraman before being gunned down by Laakso. Meanwhile, Stone finds a car in the garage before being saved by Kolya, who shows impressive hand-to-hand combat skills.
As the three survivors drive into the forest, they are attacked again by Niemi, but manage to escape him relatively easily. Stopping at another cabin, the three survivors bicker about whether to confront the supernatural threat or leave it behind, before they find Kolya's ex-girlfriend Dasha (Gorska). The four then proceed on to the bunker, where Kolya insists they can find a radio to call for help. Entering the facility, they are again split up - as Kolya finds Dacha mortally wounded, having to shoot her in the head to prevent her from turning, Laakso and Stone find the living remnants of the German garrison. As Stone stays behind to cover Laakso, the Finn is reunited with Kolya and the two find the radio room, where they call headquarters to call in an airstrike to take the bunker out for good.
Niemi appears again at the bunker and engages in a fist-fight with Stone, while the radio room is overrun by zombies and Laakso and Kolya are forced to flee. As they near the exit to the surface, Kolya is grabbed by a zombie and falls to his death, with Laakso forced to leave him as he races topside to set the signal flares for the incoming fighter-bombers. Narrowly escaping the bombs, Laakso meets up with Stone again as they surrender to the incoming Russian battalion which has been called to investigate the site, knowing their job is done.

'''''Zone of the Dead''''', also known as '''Apocalypse of the Dead''' ('''''Zona Mrtvih''''' in Serbian) is a 2009 Serbian horror film by directors Milan Konjevic and Milan Todorovic. It stars Ken Foree, most well known for his starring role in ''Dawn of the Dead'' in 1978.
In 1986, in Chernobyl a mass grave of bodies is discovered, resembling victims of the Plague. The Chief of Bureau (Eugeni Roig) arrives at the scene and is informed that a man cut himself on a corpse's ribcage and died of infection minutes after. Seconds later, that same man rises up attacks them both.
Twenty years later, a local professor (Steve Agnew) is trying to catch a train out of Pancevo, Serbia, but finds that all railroads have been closed down as part of a military exercise. While he tries to make a call, a train comes in carrying a deadly biohazard agent monitored by a scientist in a hazmat suit, who asks for permission to pass through.  Before he can, a trio of drunken off-duty soldiers emerge and harass the station guard taking his weapon and inadvertently rupturing the tank, releasing the chemical agent into the atmosphere. All the soldiers and the station guard are infected by the gas, becoming zombies but the professor manages to escape.
Meanwhile, INTERPOL Agent, Mina Milieus (Kristina Klebe) is tasked transporting a mysterious prisoner (Emilio Roso) is from Serbia to Belgrave, while under the supervision of Agent Mortimer "Morty" Reyes (Ken Foree), an ex-CIA agent and on the verge of retiring, along with his partner, Inspector Dragan "Dra" Belic (Miodrag Krstovic). While Mila is in awe of Morty, she is also nervous as this is her first assignment in the field. Marty assures her that she will be fine, considering this to be the easiest assignment he's ever had.
The Chief of Bureau meets with the President and informs him about the accident at the train station in Pancevo. He discloses that the agent in the tank was capable of reanimating dead cells and advises that he not bother with evacuation, but contain the incident and let the National Guard deal with the rest.
Back in Pancevo, a young reporter, Jan (Marko Janjic) is wasting his time at a minor concert, and is eventually convinced by his girlfriend Angela (Ariadna Cabrol) to leave along with her friend, Jovana (Iskra Brajovic). At the same time, the professor is trying to escape the growing number of infected.  He comes across another escaped felon, Armageddon (Vukota Brajovic) who states the End of Days has arrived, and has made it his personal mission to eradicate the zombies. The professor runs away and meets Jan and the girls, who allow him to come into their car,
The two INTERPOL vans arrive in Pancevo just as the driver, Petrovic hits a zombie. When they go out to investigate, several more arrive separating them from Agents, Bottin (Vahidin Prelic) and Savini (Zeljko Sesta). They attempt to contact Headquarters for backup, there is no signal. Upon finding the second van, containing the Prisoner, Morty finds Bottin and Savini are dead and more zombies are coming. The Prisoner tells them to shoot the zombies in the head, which proves to be successful, but they are quickly overwhelmed: Petrovic is devoured and Dra is bitten on the hand. With little choice, they are forced to take shelter in a nearby abandoned police station.
While reconnoitring the area, Morty and Dra find the professor, Jan and the girls, and bring them back to the reception. The Prisoner attempts to flirt with Mila, but she rebuffs him, although she is put off by how he knew she was a rookie. Meanwhile, Armageddon continues his rampage on the zombies, using multiple weapons at his disposal. He enters a local TV Station and broadcasts his declaration of the apocalypse to Pancevo, including the station. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Morty decides to activate the generator and find a way out. Dra is unable to come with him and has begun to succumb to infection, resulting in Morty freeing the Prisoner and taking him along. After turning the power on, several zombies break in and nearly kill Morty, but the Prisoner saves him. Dra subsequently dies and reanimates forcing Mila to shoot him. Jovana, driven insane by the turn of events, breaks down the barricade, allowing herself to be eaten. The professor also chooses death, by Morty's gun, feeling that "there are worse things."
The group escapes and heads towards the river through the train tunnels. The Prisoner reveals to Mila that he knows of the zombies because his father was one of them as a result of the incident in Chernobyl. He goes on to explain the President will most likely 'cleanse' the city to prevent the spread of infection. Upon arriving at the shipyards, they find a horde of sleeping zombies which are awoken by the Hazmat zombie. Morty leads the zombies away while the rest of the group makes for the boat.
Morty runs out of ammo and gets trapped inside a train, while Jan takes the boat and abandons Angela. Just as she is about to be eaten, Armageddon arrives and supplies the group with weapons; Mila with a rifle, and the Prisoner with a broadsword. The three proceed to kill the zombies, while Morty escapes the train, taking a gun from the Prisoner and helping them out. Armageddon finishes off the undead and the Prisoner decapitates the Hazmat zombie, apparently ending the threat.
Later, the President announces that he will cooperating with NATO to bring all those responsible for the bioweapon to justice, much to The Chief of Bureau's chagrin. The President considers his decision to be "a necessary evil" and expects the Chief to resign, effective immediately. Mila allows the Prisoner to leave, despite having some ammo in her guns, showing respect for him. Morty congratulates her on her efforts, in spite of the mission not being completed, saying he messed up his first one as well. Milo asks who the Prisoner was, to which Morty replies: "Nobody Special."
As they leave, Armageddon completes his prophesy, possibly answering Mila's question: "And he shall raise his hands with the Sword of Vengeance. The Flaming Blade of the Lord's Retribution. And his eyes were as a flame of fire… And he had a name written… which no man knoweth but himself."
In the final scene, Jan has taken the boat up the river, only for it to run out of gas. As he heads to the cabin to look for more, the infected captain lurches out and tackles them both into the river.

'''''Aversion''''' is a 2009 horror film about a private investigator who discovers too late that the woman he is hired to follow is often possessed by a demon.
Under the direction of GF Roberts the original script, written by Roberts and Ted Spencer, combines demonic possession with science fiction. The film is somewhat retro in nature because it was shot on photographic film and that over ninety percent of the effects are in camera. The tone of Aversion differs from many contemporary movies by providing some comic relief throughout.
The on-set special effects were provided by Monster in My Closet FX under the supervision of Jeremy Selenfriend. Other crew members included assistant director Sabrina Simone, Jared Noe and D Garcia.
This original story marries three different elements into one plot.
Alex Stokes (Andrew Roth) is a self-destructive, down-on-his-luck investigator who takes cases wherever he can. When a mysterious man offers him a healthy sum to follow his beautiful wife Claire (Melantha Blackthorne), Alex can't resist. Her seemingly mundane day-to-day activities take a strange turn when she tries to kill herself. 
After saving her, their chemistry proves too much to resist and they become romantically entangled. But the fun has just begun as her demonic possessions escalate and Alex's entire town gets sucked into a vortex of evil. Can one lost soul get it together in time to save mankind?
The movie is a film noir, where a self-destructive, down-and-out investigator takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman, excessive drinking and subtle voiceover, the piece is set up like a standard detective film.
*Andrew Roth as Alex
*Melantha Blackthorne as Claire
* as Neil
*Richard Flight as Belial
*Ted Spencer as Dr. Cliff
*Janette Temerian as Liz
*George Walsh as The Sarge
*Josh Berresford as Cyril
Quite a few casting sessions were held and there was always one outstanding actor for every role. Fortunately, when offers were made, no one turned down the roles, so essentially a dream cast was assembled.
GF Roberts has been shooting independent film in New York City for years. His projects range from comedy to horror and film to music videos. Starting with short films shot on video with his friends, Roberts discovered that he had a knack for telling stories with the camera. Years later, after scripting a feature film, which was produced, he joined the production team and never looked back. He began shooting film-based projects and after investing in equipment began his own production company. From there he learned the workings of the camera and after sufficient experience he hired himself out as a cinematographer, working on several films. He has also shot music videos and a spec television show. He recently completed "The Citizen Core", which was an official selection in the Philadelphia Independent Film Festival and Sarah's Demons, a horror short was an official selection in the 2008 Bare Bones International Film Festival.
The movie's opening scene was shot in Pennsylvania. The interrogation scenes were shot in Brooklyn. The bulk of the film though, was shot in upstate New York, mainly Woodstock, New York, the infamous site of the 1969 concert, Kingston, New York and Red Hook, NY. Although the film has various locations, it is not supposed to take place anywhere specific.

'''''I Am Omega''''', stylized as '''''I Am Omega''''', is a 2007 direct-to-DVD American doomsday film produced by The Asylum and starring Mark Dacascos. The film is an unofficial adaptation of the novel ''I Am Legend'' by Richard Matheson, the title being a reference to previous adaptation ''The Omega Man''. The movie was intentionally released as a "mockbuster" to capitalize on the release of the theatrical film ''I Am Legend'' of the same year. by Todd McCarthy, Variety, Dec. 7, 2007.
The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, which is overrun by zombie-like, cannibalistic humans who have degenerated into a feral subspecies as the result of a genetic infection. The film does not make clear if the virus has infected the entire world, or just a small, isolated area, but it is suggested that it is global by the inability of the hero, Renchard (Mark Dacascos), to locate radio signals or contact anyone via the Internet.
Renchard has been forced to live in a daily struggle for survival against the mutants. One day, Renchard is contacted via webcam by Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), another survivor who was stranded in L.A. while trying to find Antioch, a community of survivors. She asks Renchard to help her, but Renchard, who has placed time bombs at strategic points around the city, refuses. 
Two men (Geoff Meed and Ryan Lloyd) claiming to be from Antioch arrive at his home seeking his aid.  Although initially unpersuaded by their argument that Brianna carries the cure to the virus in her blood, Renchard is forced to cooperate under gunpoint. With 24 hours before the bombs are set to detonate, he leads the men into the city.  They must find and free Brianna before the mutants or the bombs can destroy them. After Renchard and Brianna flee the city and Mike (Ryan Lloyd) is killed in the sewers, Vincent (Geoff Meed) shoots Renchard and captures Brianna. He tells Renchard he did it because he liked the world the way it was and leaves him to die. After Renchard recovers his strength, he hotwires a car and chases after Vincent to save Brianna.
After finding them, Renchard kills Vincent, who was attempting to rape and kill Brianna. The bombs explode, and they both head to Antioch to make a cure. However, it is revealed that a single zombie has survived the explosion.
This low-budget, direct-to-video film was hurried into production and released a month prior to the big budget Will Smith film ''I Am Legend'' in an attempt to cash in on the similar-sounding titles and plots., National Public Radio, December 8, 2007. by GRADY HENDRIX, The NY Sun, January 18, 2008. 
This has led to some confusion among film fans, which is no doubt the intention of film distributor The Asylum, who have used this marketing strategy in the past with such other confusingly-titled films as ''30,000 Leagues Under the Sea'', ''Transmorphers'', ''The Da Vinci Treasure'' and ''Snakes on a Train''.. ''The New York Times'', 2007-OCT-7.
Critics had few good things to say about the film. Matt Bradshaw said, "The film starts off with a modest amount of promise, but when the story veers away from the film it's aping things quickly go down hill." by Matt Bradshaw, Cinematical, Dec. 17, 2007. ''The San Diego Union Tribune'' said satirically that the film is "The long-awaited prequel to ''Animal House'', in which Bluto's secret pact with that reviled rival frat is finally revealed?" by James Hebert, The San Diego Union Tribune, December 14, 2007, accessed Jan. 16, 2009. 
''Film Critics United'' said that "As far as flicks from The Asylum go, ''I am Omega'' is their best one yet, at least of the ones I've seen. Admittedly this includes fare such as ''Snakes on a Train, Transmorphers'' and ''Super Croc'', all surely among the worst films ever made, but for a little while at least ''I am Omega'' was more than just a 'good flick for Asylum standards' but just a plain old decent flick. For a little while at least."

'''''I Walked with a Zombie''''' is a 1943 horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur. It was the second horror film from producer Val Lewton for RKO Pictures.
Betsy Connell (Frances Dee), a Canadian nurse, relates in a voiceover how she once "walked with a zombie."
Betsy is hired to care for the wife of Paul Holland (Tom Conway), a sugar plantation owner on the Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian. Saint Sebastian is inhabited by a small white community and descendants of African slaves. Betsy is told the story of how the Hollands brought slaves to the island, and that the statue of "Ti-Misery" (Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows) in the courtyard is the figurehead from a slave ship.
That night at dinner, Betsy meets Paul's half-brother and employee, Wesley Rand (James Ellison). While getting ready for bed, Betsy hears crying. When she investigates, a woman in a white robe walks towards her, her eyes staring. Betsy screams, waking the rest of the household. Paul takes charge of Jessica Holland, the woman Betsy is to care for. The next morning, Dr. Maxwell tells Betsy that Jessica's spinal cord was irreparably damaged by a serious illness, leaving her totally without the willpower to do anything for herself.
On her day off, Betsy encounters Wesley in town. While he drinks himself into a stupor, a calypso singer (Sir Lancelot) sings about how Jessica was going to run away with Wesley, but Paul would not let them go. Then she was struck down by the fever. Betsy meets Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett), Paul and Wesley's doctor mother.
That night, at dinner, Paul tries to persuade Wesley to reduce his drinking (at Betsy's suggestion), but he accuses Paul of trying to impress Betsy and of driving Jessica insane in the first place.
Later, Betsy is drawn to the sound of Paul playing the piano. He apologizes for bringing her to the island and admits that he may have been the cause of his wife's condition. Betsy has been falling in love with her moody employer. She determines to make him happy by curing Jessica.
Betsy gets Paul to agree to try a potentially fatal treatment of insulin shock on Jessica, but it has no effect. Housemaid Alma (Theresa Harris) then tells her that a Voodoo priest cured a woman of a similar condition. Betsy takes her patient without permission through cane fields past a crossroads guarded by the towering figure of the eerie Carre-Four (a reference to the loa Maitre Carrefours) to the houmfort (a place where Voodoo worshipers gather).
There, they watch a man (the Sabreur) wield a saber during a ritual. People are given advice through a shack door by a Voodoo priest. Betsy is summoned inside, where she is shocked to find that the priest is none other than Mrs. Rand. 
Mrs. Rand explains that she uses Voodoo to convince the natives to accept conventional medical practices and tells Betsy that Jessica can never be cured.
Outside, the locals stab Jessica in the arm with the sword as a test. When she does not bleed, they are convinced she is a zombie. Betsy takes her back to the house, but the natives demand that Jessica be returned to them for "ritual tests". Later, Carre-Four approaches the residence, but Mrs. Rand orders him to leave.
Paul suggests that Betsy return to Canada, as he is fearful of demeaning and abusing her as he did Jessica. She is convinced that he is not really like that.
The next day, Doctor Maxwell reports that the unrest has sparked an official inquiry into Jessica's illness. Mrs. Rand shocks everyone by claiming that Jessica is a zombie. Although she had never taken Voodoo seriously, Mrs Rand reveals that when she discovered that Jessica was planning to run away with Wesley and break up her family, she felt herself Spirit possession#In Haitian Vodou and African traditions|possessed by a Voodoo god. She then put a curse on Jessica. Paul, Maxwell and Betsy dismiss her story, but Wesley becomes obsessed with freeing Jessica from her zombie state. He asks Betsy if she would consider euthanasia, but she refuses.
Using an effigy of Jessica, the Sabreur takes control of her and draws her to him. Paul and Betsy stop her the first time, but they are not around when he tries again. Wesley opens the gate, letting Jessica out. Then he pulls an arrow out of the statue of Ti-Misery and follows. As the Sabreur stabs the doll with a pin, Wesley thrusts the arrow into Jessica. He then carries her body into the sea, pursued slowly by Carre-Four. Later, the natives discover the bodies of Jessica and Wesley floating in the surf. Paul comforts Betsy.

Producer Val Lewton was forced to use the film's title by RKO executives. Officially, the film was based on an article written by Inez Wallace for ''American Weekly Magazine.''Wallace, Inez. "I Walked with a Zombie." Reprinted in Peter Haining, Zombie! Stories of the Walking Dead (London 1986): pp.95- 102. Lewton asked his writers to use Charlotte Brontë's ''Jane Eyre'' for giving the story a narrative structure and to do research on Haitian voodoo practices.
Anna Lee was originally slated for the Frances Dee role, but had to bow out due to another commitment.
While ''I Walked with a Zombie'' was declared to be "a dull, disgusting exaggeration of an unhealthy, abnormal concept of life" by ''The New York Times'' in 1943, in ''The New York Times'', April 22, 1943 critics later called it "intelligent" (William K. Everson),William K. Everson: ''Classics of the Horror Film''. The Citadel Press, 1974. "exceptional" (Leonard Maltin)''Leonard Maltin's 2008 Movie Guide''. Signet/Penguin Group, 2007. and "the most elegant" in Lewton's RKO horror series (Tom Milne).''Time Out Film Guide, Seventh Edition 1999''. Penguin Group, 1998.
The film's treatment of the supernatural element repeatedly attracted interest among reviewers:
*"As with all of Val Lewton's films, ''I Walked with a Zombie'' hovers on the deliberate edge of ambiguity between whether the explanation for events is mundane or supernatural. [...] The central belief/doubt ambiguity of the film hovers around the question of whether Jessica is suffering from tropical fever or has been affected by voodoo. The film sits just between rationalism and superstition - its duality plays on the conflict between Western Christendom and Caribbean culture, and between medicine and magic." - Richard ScheibRichard Scheib: ''I Walked with a Zombie'' review on 
*"In [''I Walked with a Zombie''] belief in the supernatural is but one of many faults in the human character. The script never confirms the reality of Voodoo even when it is clear that the Voodoo masters are controlling the zombie Carre-Four. It's worth noting that Wesley 'falls under the voodoo spell' only after despairing of the hopeless state of affairs at the Hammond house, and sinking into a deep depression.  [...] Lewton's theme is that human nature creates Evil -- that unresolved guilt and suspicions from the past dominate the Hammond family's present. Better natures are stifled, starting a chain of human misery that leads to tragedy. The result -- wasted lives and blighted vitality -- is as pervasive as the creeping Voodoo beliefs themselves. " - Glenn EricksonGlenn Erickson: ''The Val Lewton Collection'' review on 
In 2007, ''Stylus Magazine'' named it the fifth best zombie movie of all time.

The full budget of ''Dark Floors'' reached $4.3 million (U.S.), making it one of the most expensive films made in Finland. Most of the budget was spent on special effects design, set construction, and a large marketing campaign, along with the post-production process.
The sets were the largest constructed in Finland, taking up 1700 square metres during the basement carpark scene. It had been originally planned to shoot the film on location in the Baltics, but the village of Oulu was chosen instead, with special effects used to replicate a city when necessary. The production team visited hospitals to research the workings of an X-ray, thereby adding both credibility and authenticity to the CGI-rendered X-rays shown. When principal photography was completed, the extended post-production phase was launched, including the insertion of Awa's ghostly appearance. 
The film was originally intended to premiere in 2007, at the Eurovision song contest in Helsinki, whose opening number, featuring Lordi, with a performance of 'Hard Rock Hallelujah.' Unfortunately, the team could not finish their tasks in time; moreover, Lordi were already putting final touches on their Bringing Back the Balls to Europe tour. Post-production was therefore expanded into May of the same year, and was eventually rescheduled to December.
The press conference was held at the Cannes Film Festival the weekend of the 19th and 20 May 2007. Lordi appeared personally, as did director Pete Riski, producer Markus Selin, and virtually all the leading actors. All involved responded to questions, and shared unusual anecdotes on making the film.
''Dark Floors'' was slowly 'leaked' by way of a marketing campaign, and the press were permitted to witness the production of Kita's lift scene, although everything else was kept under wraps.
The film was released on DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2 DVD in the UK by Metrodome Distribution on 20 April 2009, priced at £12.99 RRP.  The release includes several DVD-Video#Extra features|extra features, listed as "Behind the Scenes of ''Dark Floors''", "Cast & Crew Interviews", and "''Dark Floors'' World Premiere featurette including Q&A with Lordi, the cast and crew and a live Lordi performance". The film is rated 18 by the BBFC for "strong bloody violence and horror".
Derek Elley of ''Variety'' called it "a cultural oddity with an OK concept" that will perform well on video.

 zombie action film co-written, produced, and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. The film is set somewhere in the deep forest of Japan, known as the ''Forest of Resurrection'', where an escaped convict simply referred to as "Prisoner KSC2-303" and a gang of Yakuza battle a horde of zombies while at the same time dealing with their sinister leader who wishes to open the forest's portal of darkness.
Originally intended as a sequel to Kitamura's ''Down to Hell'', the script surpassed expectations and ultimately evolved into a different film. Though the film was not released theatrically worldwide (except in France), ''Versus'' managed to gain a cult following after its DVD release. In 2004, an extended version called ''Ultimate Versus'' was released which included 10 minutes of new footage, as well as additional new music, CGI, and a few editing tweaks.
''Versus'' combines elements of multiple genres such as gunplay, martial arts action, chanbara sword fighting, zombie horror, and comedy. Director Kitamura chose this creative decision because he believed ''Versus'' could have been his first and last film  he'd ever produce and chose to risk everything by adding film elements that influenced him.
Talk of an American remake and sequel began to circulate in 2008 following the release of Kitamura's Hollywood directing debut, ''The Midnight Meat Train''. However, no news of the remake or sequel has emerged since 2008.
Unknown to the world, there are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the other side which are concealed from human beings. However, there are some who are aware of their existence and are willing to locate and open the gates of the portals to obtain the power of darkness for their own pleasure. Somewhere in Japan, there exists the 444th portal known as ''The Forest of Resurrection''.
In 10th century Japan, a lone samurai fends off a horde of zombie-like samurai creatures. Though successfully vanquishing the zombies, the samurai is confronted by a mysterious priest and his league of warriors. In an attempt to take out the mysterious priest, the lone samurai charges full scale but is easily killed and defeated. However, before dying, the lone samurai spots an ally behind him, arriving too late to save him.
In present-day Japan, two prisoners escape through a forest and meet up with a gang of Yakuzas. When Prisoner KSC2-303 (Tak Sakaguchi) sees a girl (Chieko Misaka) that the gang kidnapped, he immediately becomes suspicious of what they plan to do with her. After a heated argument, Prisoner KSC2-303 kills one of the Yakuza members who immediately comes back to life as a zombie. The zombies are killed and Prisoner KSC2-303 escapes back into the forest with The Girl. The Yakuza decide to disobey their orders to wait for their leader and pursue Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl.
Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl come across a man crucified upon a tree. Prisoner KSC2-303 steals the dead man's clothes and is confronted by one of the Yakuza. They engage in hand-to-hand combat while the other Yakuza begin facing problems of their own. The corpses of all the men they have killed and buried in the forest come back to life and attack them. Prisoner KSC2-303 and the other Yakuza abandon their fight to battle the zombies.
With the horde of zombies growing, the Yakuza call upon three assassins to aid them in their mission. The Yakuza leader, The Man (Hideo Sakaki), finally arrives and confronts them, angry that they lost Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl. The Yakuza and Assassins take the upper hand and kill him first. But The Man easily jumps back to his feet and turns the Assassins and Yakuza into his own minions. Two of the Assassins escape and find Prisoner KSC2-303. One is defeated by The Girl with a log, and the other is confronted by The Man and killed.
Prisoner KSC2-303 attempts to force The Girl to tell him what is going on, believing that she has been hiding secrets from him the whole time. Before explaining thoroughly, The Man finds Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl. The Man begins explaining to Prisoner KSC2-303 that they are reincarnations of past lives. The Man plans to use The Girl as a sacrifice to open the portal hidden in The Forest of Resurrection to obtain the power of darkness. Unable to accept his explanations, Prisoner KSC2-303 attempts to kill The Man but is killed himself instead.
The Girl manages to reach Prisoner KSC2-303's body and feeds him a part of her blood before being taken by The Man's minions. During his unconscious state, Prisoner KSC2-303 experiences a flashback of his past life in the 10th century; he is the ally that was too late to save the lone samurai in the opening scene of the movie. He and The Girl (who is revealed to be a princess) are confronted by the mysterious priest (who turns out to be The Man) and his gang. Outnumbered and facing long odds, Pre-Prisoner KSC2-303 reluctantly kills The Girl to stop The Man from obtaining the power of darkness. Enraged, The Man viciously kills Pre-Prisoner KSC2-303. Prisoner KSC2-303 is awakened in the present with the truth fully revealed to him.
The following morning, Prisoner KSC2-303 confronts The Man and his minions for a final showdown. Prisoner KSC2-303 takes on the minions first and wins, leaving only The Man left. Prisoner KSC2-303 decapitates The Man and rescues The Girl and both make their escape from The Forest of Resurrection.
99 years later, Earth lies in ruin. The reincarnation of The Man travels through the remains of a city, and eventually confronts Prisoner KSC2-303 and the reincarnated versions of The Man's gang (who now work for KSC2-303). The Girl, held against her will, tells the The Man that she should have been on his side 99 years earlier. With nothing left to destroy in this world, Prisoner KSC2-303 asks The Man to take him to the Other Side. The Man and Prisoner KSC2-303 charge at each other and engage in battle one more time.

Originally, ''Versus'' was intended to be a sequel to director Kitamura's "amateur" short film '''''Down to Hell''''', with the intention of also shooting ''Versus'' on video with a low budget as he did with ''Down to Hell'' but instead decided to shoot on film with budget of $10,000 for a theatrical release.
According to Kitamura, he raised the money to independently produce ''Versus'' by borrowing money from friends and family after Producers refused to produce an action film with him because, to them, it was impossible to achieve due to the lack of time and money.
Tak Sakaguchi was hired for the lead after director Kitamura saw a gag video that featured Sakaguchi. Kitamura's main reason for hiring Sakaguchi was because he had "a beautiful smile;" however, Sakaguchi claims he met Kitamura during a street fight which Sakaguchi was involved in. Kitamura offered him a role in his film after asking him if he'd rather fight in the streets or fight in his films. Kitamura later vouched as well that he met Sakaguchi during a street fight.
Despite this, there have been several interpretations of the ending. Some fans have suggested that the ending revealed that Prisoner KSC2-303 was actually the villain the whole time. This is apparent when The Girl tells The Man directly ''"I should have been on your side"''. Others suggest that Prisoner KSC2-303 was just simply reincarnated as the villain this time and The Man in the opposite role. Kitamura has not given an explanation for the ending and has left its outcome for fans to decide for themselves.
The film did not receive the title ''Versus'' until the end of shooting. During production, the film was referred to as ''The Return: Down 2 Hell'', despite the fact that the film was not going to be released under that title. In fact, a friend of Kitamura's (who would end up working with the director as a second unit director for Godzilla: Final Wars) suggested the title ''Versus'' to reference the struggles Kitamura suffered through while trying to launch his career.
''"I didn't actually have the title Versus until the very end of shooting. We were still using 'Return to Hell: Down to Hell 2' as a title. Of course it wasn't Down to Hell 2 at all anymore, but I couldn't come up with a good title. Then my best friend - he went to Australia with me when I was 17 and he is now the second unit director on Godzilla, shooting the overseas sequences - he was shooting the making of Versus at the time and I told him I couldn't come up with a good title. He told me, "All your life you've been fighting, and this movie is all you, so you should call it Versus." He is the one that came up with that excellent title".'' - Ryuhei Kitamura, interview with Midnight Eye.
In the film's North American DVD/Blu-ray audio commentary, Kitamura has stated that ''Versus'' pays homage to such films as ''The Evil Dead'' and ''Highlander'', upon which the film has been compared to with by some critics. Director Kitamura stated that ''Versus'' was inspired by the films of Sam Raimi, John Carpenter, and George Miller.
''Versus'' has also established what would become Kitamura's signature style of filmmaking, which would be seen in his later films. As seen in the film, Kitamura makes use of bullet time photography, stylized choreographed action, flexible camera work, and a unique soundtrack combining elements of industrial music, electronica, rock mixed with orchestral elements, all composed by his regular soundtrack collaborator Nobuhiko Morino.
Kitamura commented on his style, "It's all me. It's all Ryuhei Kitamura-style, and I'm not going to try to change or steer away from anything. I'm only trying to get better."
''Versus'' gained mainly a positive reception. Rotten Tomatoes reported a 67% rating approval rating. The Rolling Stone called the film ''"A Japanese zombies-vs.-gangsters action-horror comedy that plays like Quentin Tarantino remaking THE EVIL DEAD while on a speed binge"''. Sight & Sound praised the film by commenting ''"With Kurosawa-style swordplay, martial arts and elaborately choreographed gun battles"''. Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News commented on the film ''"I've never seen anything like it, it's a new kind of movie."'' B.P. called the film ''"Poetic and splendid, this movie thrilled me"'' and MADMOVIE claimed ''"Hollywood made Hong Kong-style movies will never come close to his (Ryuhei Kitamura) movie."''
There are three different versions of ''Versus'', the original cut, the R-rated cut, and the Ultimate edition. Prior to being released commercially in the United States in 2004, DVD distributor Media Blasters produced an R-rated edited cut which removed the film's gore scenes. As a result, the R-rated cut is four minutes shorter than the original cut. Around that same time, ''The Ultimate Versus'' was produced and released which featured ten minutes of additional newly filmed footage as well as some additions to the film.
In 2004, director Kitamura and most of the original cast and crew returned to the forest to film new scenes to further realize Kitamura's vision of the film. Tak Sakaguchi directed the action sequences for the new footage due to Yûji Shimomura being unavailable at the time. The new footage was shot in five days at the same location where the original production was shot.
Released in a 3-disc DVD set by Media Blasters, over 75% of the film now feature some sort of reworking, be it color correction, new music, added action sequences, or full scene replacement. The result is a fuller story and character development, with added effects such as more blood in certain scenes, sparks during sword fights, and so on.
In 2008, around the release of his American directorial debut ''Midnight Meat Train'', Ryuhei Kitamura began mentioning a possible American remake of ''Versus''.
Kitamura managed to write a full script for the American version and has stated that "The US Versus will be insane!"
On an audio commentary for the film, Kitamura has said that if a sequel would ever be made, it would pick up to where the first film ended, taking place 99 years into the future.
In a 2010 interview, Kitamura commented on the remake "This year  will be tenth anniversary year of Versus so I'm thinking of doing something special. The original film means a lot to me and has huge fans all over the world, so I can't do anything easy or cheap - I can't guarantee anything in the long run, it's a definite that I'll do the new Versus in the future for sure."
In May 2013, while promoting the film ''No One Lives'', Kitamura announced that a sequel to ''Versus'' was in development, tentatively titled ''Versus 2''. He confirmed that he had written the script, and that Sakaguchi would likely reprise his role as KSC2-303.

'''''The Dead Hate the Living!''''' is a 2000 low budget zombie film written and directed by Dave Parker and produced by Full Moon Entertainment.
When a renegade band of young filmmakers break into an abandoned hospital to make their horror epic, they stumble upon a real dead body and decide to use it in their movie. They accidentally bring it back to life, open a portal to a dead world that releases dozens of other zombies, then struggle for their lives in a desperate attempt to flee from the creatures who apparently have them hopelessly trapped in the hospital.

''Fatally Yours'' offered in their review that [the film] "is straight up one of the best Full Moon Entertainment movies out there for sure", praising the director and casting. They concluded by remarking that while the film might "seem like your typical cheesy horror film it does have it memorable moments that make you happy to be able to be viewing it."  ''Beyond Hollywood'' wrote that the film began with "the biggest cliche' of movie cliche's" in that the protagonists were themselves filmmakers filming a horror movie scene as part of the horror movie itself. They made note of the low budget and that the film was no exception to films of this genre not being known for presenting great acting, underscoring that the first 20 minutes were "excruciatingly bad", though granting that the acting did get better, leading the reviewer to suppose that the project was possibly shot in the same order as scripted, allowing the actors to become more comfortable with their characters as the film progressed.  ''eFilmCritic'' found the film to be "easily one of the absolute worst films to ever smudge a rental store shelf", opining that the film's script was cliche' and unoriginal, the pacing would "cause even snails to squirm with impatience", and concluding the review by writing the film was "horribly directed, horribly shot, and just plain horribly executed."  Mike Bracken of IGN wrote, "Ultimately, this is one of the better zombie flicks to come along in awhile".  Glenn Kay wrote that the film is enthusiastic, but "most viewers will agree that the living hate ''The Dead Hate the Living!''"

'''''The Video Dead''''' is a 1987 horror comedy film written and directed by Robert Scott and starring Roxanna Augesen.  A paranormal television causes zombies from a never-ending film to enter the real world.  The film was released direct-to-video and has been re-released several times since then.
A writer finds that an unsolicited television has been delivered to his house. The writer discovers that the only program the television is capable of picking up is a seemingly endless, plotless, black and white zombie film titled ''Zombie Blood Nightmare''. Despite unplugging the television set, it nonetheless reactivates and spawns the film's zombies, who attack and kill the writer. The next day, the delivery men arrive to claim the set, realizing that it was meant to go to the Institute for Paranormal Research; they find only the body of the writer, bound in his front hallway and dressed in party clothes.
Three months later, teenagers Zoe and Jeff arrive at the house ahead of their parents, who are moving back to the United States after years abroad. Jeff quickly befriends dog walker April and accompanies her home, where the dog she is watching escapes into the woods behind their neighborhood. It stumbles upon the zombies that had initially escaped the set, and which have been living in the wilderness ever since. The zombies kill the dog, leave it for Jeff and Zoe to find, and follow the pair back to the neighborhood.
That afternoon, a man named Joshua Daniels comes to their front door looking for the television set, claiming that he bought it at a yard sale and mailed it to the Paranormal Institute after it killed his wife. Jeff turns him away, but later that night discovers the television set, which has mysteriously migrated to the attic. A bizarre woman briefly appears on the set, beckoning to Jeff, before a man appears and kills her, revealing her to be a zombie. The man, who calls himself "The Garbage Man", says that the only way to prevent more zombies from coming from the set is to tape a mirror to it.
The next day the zombies arrive in the neighborhood and kill April's father, his maid, and their next-door neighbors before laying siege to Zoe and Jeff's house. Jeff, Zoe, and April hole themselves up along with Joshua, who has returned in another attempt to reclaim the television set. Joshua explains the psychology of the zombies: realizing that they are in a liminal state between life and death, the zombies kill humans out of envy. They are repulsed by mirrors because it reminds them of their own hideousness, and attack when they sense fear. The zombies can be destroyed by severely wounding them, thus "convincing" them that they are dead.  The zombie must then be dismembered and left unburied, to be "consumed by mother nature."  Joshua warns against burying them.  They can also be destroyed by trapping them in an enclosed space, which will cause the zombies to go into a psychotic state and cannibalize one another.
Despite the fortifications, a zombie breaks in and incapacitates April. Zoe and Jeff lock the zombie out of the house after it leaves with April's body. The next morning, Joshua and Jeff head into the woods to hunt down the zombies. Joshua sets traps and takes up a sniper position while using Jeff as bait. Using a bow and arrows, they shoot and incapacitate all the zombies but one, whom they pursue. Joshua is killed when an arrow is shoved through his chest and Jeff gets trapped in a shed, where he discovers April's now lifeless body. The lone remaining zombie wakes the other zombies from their delusions of death, and the zombies rise up.  The lone zombie breaks into the shed and faces Jeff.  Jeff decapitates the zombie with a machete, but the zombie simultaneously runs Jeff through with the chainsaw, killing him.
The remaining zombies return to the house where Zoe remains alone.  Remembering that the zombies only attack when they sense fear, Zoe invites the zombies into the house, where they become docile. Zoe tricks them into entering the basement.  She locks them in, but not before uncovering a mirror on the inside of the basement door.  The zombies are trapped and go berserk. After they consume each other, their remains are sucked back into the television, and ''Zombie Blood Nightmare'' finally ends.
Sometime later, Zoe's parents come to visit her in hospital, where she is being treated for severe  post traumatic stress disorder. They unwittingly bring her the possessed television set from the house in the hopes that a familiar item will help her recover.  Her parents and the hospital orderly all leave, leaving Zoe alone in the room.  The television begins to play ''Zombie Blood Nightmare'' once again. Zoe looks at the screen in horror as one of the zombies within the TV looks directly at her and starts growling. The screen goes black and we hear Zoe scream.

'''''Zombie Nation''''' is a 2005 American independent horror film written and directed by Ulli Lommel. Despite its title, only five zombies appear in the entire film. 
Police officer Joe Singer lives a secret night life in which he kidnaps women, and takes them bound to his warehouse loft, injects them with a mysterious liquid, and then murders them. During his day shift as a cop, Joe is angry and vitriolic on the job. He arrests a woman for jay walking and she ends up in the loft. A psychiatrist visits Joe and keeps repeating, "Is it safe?" A group of Voodoo priestesses perform a ritual that brings several of Joe's victims back to life as zombies. These girls attack and eat random people before they eventually find Joe.
Reception of the film has been overwhelmingly negative.

The film takes place in the city of Los Angeles, California, and follows two intertwined plots.
The main plot concerns a meteorite that crashes in Los Angeles. It carries alien spores that spread across the city, transforming humans into flesh-eating zombies.
The other story is about two rival gangs, "The Lords of Crenshaw" and "El Diablo", who continue to fight for dominance of Los Angeles even as it falls to the zombie horde.

In both Germany and Italy, the film was released under the title of '''''City of the Dead'''''.
In the United Kingdom, the film was released under the title of '''''48 Weeks Later''''', in an effort to capitalise on the success of ''28 Weeks Later'', which had been released in 2007.

'''''The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies''''' (sometimes "!!?" is appended to the title) is a 1964 American monster movie written and directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. Steckler also starred in the film, billed under the pseudonym "Cash Flagg". Upon release, the film was widely panned and is regarded by some critics as being one of the worst movies ever made.
In the film, three friends visit a carnival and stumble into a group of occultists and disfigured monsters.  Produced on a $38,000 budget, much of it takes place at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach, California, which resembles Brooklyn's Coney Island. The film was billed as the first "monster musical", beating out ''The Horror of Party Beach'' by a mere month in release date.
Free spirited Jerry (Steckler as "Flagg"), his girlfriend Angela (Sharon Walsh), and his buddy Harold (Atlas King) head out for a day a seaside carnival.  In one venue, a dance number is performed by Marge (Carolyn Brandt), a superstitious alcoholic who drinks before and between shows, and her partner, Bill Ward, for a small audience.  Backstage, Marge sees a black cat, and disturbed by its appearance, visits powerful carnival fortune-teller Estrella (Brett O'Hara) to find out what it means.  In her fortune telling booth, Estrella predicts death for Marge, who runs out, terrifed, past Jerry, Angela, and Harold.  The three decide to have their fortunes told.  Estrella predicts "a death near water" for someone close to Angela.
After leaving Estrella's booth, Jerry sees Estrella's sister Carmelita (Erina Enyo), a stripper who hypnotizes him with her icy stare and he is compelled to see her act.  Angela leaves the carnival, disgusted, with Harold in tow.  After the show, Jerry is tricked backstage into Estrella's room with a note and she turns Jerry into a zombie by hypnotizing him with a spiraling wheel.  Jerry then goes on a violent overnight rampage he will have no memory of, killing Marge and fatally wounding Bill.  The next day, Jerry attempts to strangle his girlfriend Angela as well.  It develops that Estrella, with her henchman Ortega (Jack Brady), has been turning carnival patrons into zombies by throwing acid into their faces, then imprisoning them in her fortune telling booth.
Interspersed through the film are several song-and-dance production numbers in the carnival's nightclub, with songs like "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie" and "Shook out of Shape".
Jerry, suspicious of his fragmented memory, confronts Estrella at the carnival.  He is hypnotized a second time, and that night, stabs a carnival showgirl and barker in the showgirl's home.  Returning to Estrella, she throws acid in Jerry's face and attempts to imprison him, only to have her other zombies escape.  The zombies immediately kill Estrella, Carmelita, Ortega and several performers before being shot by police.  Jerry, himself partially disfigured but not a zombie, escapes the carnival and is pursued to the shoreline, where the police shoot him dead in front of Angela and Harold.  Estrella's prediction of "a death near water" for someone close to Angela is fulfilled.
At the time of release, ''The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies'' was the second longest titled film in the horror genre (Roger Corman's ''The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent'' being the first).
This was not, however, the originally intended title of the film.  As Steckler relates, the film was supposed to be titled ''The Incredibly Strange Creatures, or Why I Stopped Living and Became a Mixed-up Zombie,'' but was changed in response to Columbia Pictures' threat of a lawsuit over the name's similarity to ''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'', which was under production at the same time.
The film was originally released by Fairway-International Pictures, Arch Hall, Sr.'s studio, who put it on a lower half of a double bill with one of his own pictures.  Dissatisfied, Steckler bought the distribution rights back from Hall, purchased the rights to the Coleman Francis picture, ''The Beast of Yucca Flats'' and roadshowed the picture across the US.  In order to get repeat customers, Steckler re-titled the film numerous times, with titles such as ''The Incredibly Mixed-Up Zombie'', ''Diabolical Dr. Voodoo'' and ''The Teenage Psycho Meets Bloody Mary''.
Brett O'Hara was usually a stand-in for Susan Hayward. Madame Estrella was the only "real" role of her career.
Sharon Walsh was not originally meant to play Angela. Bonita Jade was given the role, but when it was time for her scene, she said she had to leave to meet her boyfriend, because he was performing and she always went to his gigs. Steckler was furious, and he pulled Walsh out of the chorus line, telling her she was now the female lead. Sharon had already appeared in several dance numbers during the movie and they had to "disguise" her with a new hairstyle.
The cinematography/camera operating was done by three men who would go on to become major figures in cinematography: Joseph V. Mascelli, author of ''The Five Cs of Cinematography''; Vilmos Zsigmond (listed as William Zsigmond), who won an Academy Award for his work on ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'';  and László Kovács (cinematographer)|László Kovács (listed as Leslie Kovacs).
Much of the movie was filmed in an old, long-empty Masonic temple in Glendale, California, owned by actor Rock Hudson. The nine-story building was a series of makeshift "sound stages" stacked floor after floor, some big enough to create the midway scenes indoors. This was the studio used that year for production of ''The Creeping Terror'', another low-quality monster movie. The Film Center Studios were popular with non-union producers, because they could turn off the elevator to lock out IATSE union agents, who found it difficult to climb the stairs to the seventh floor main stage.
During the filming of the movie, Steckler was in terrible need of funds, both for the movie and for rent, food and basic needs. Atlas King, who had grown close to Steckler, gave him three hundred dollars out of his own pocket. The station wagon Jerry drives in this movie was the Steckler family car.
In some screenings, employees in monster masks, sometimes including Steckler himself, would run into the theater to scare the audience (The gimmick was billed as "Hallucinogenic Hypnovision" on the film's posters).
Upon its release the film has been panned by critics with many citing it as the worst film ever made.
The 2004 DVD ''The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made'' listed this film as the worst film of all time.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449786/movieconnections
However, the film has been celebrated by fans of camp or kitsch films. 
Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2 1/2 out of 4 stars, complimenting the film's use of colors and haunting atmosphere while criticizing the film's acting, dialogue, and simplistic plot.
The rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about ''Incredibly Strange Creatures'' in which he tries to explain and justify the movie's value:
}}
It currently has a 20% "Rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
The DVD release of ''Incredibly Strange Creatures'' features a commentary track by "drive-in movie critic" Joe Bob Briggs.
A key group of the 1970s Melbourne post-punk little band scene named themselves after the film.
The film was lampooned in 1997 by ''Mystery Science Theater 3000''.

ja:???????#??????? THE MOVIE
'''''Grindhouse''''' is a 2007 American horror film double feature co-written, produced, and directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The double feature consists of two feature-length segments, Rodriguez's ''Planet Terror'' and Tarantino's ''Death Proof'', and is bookended by fictional trailers for upcoming attractions (though two of the trailers, ''Machete'' and ''Hobo with a Shotgun'', have since been made into movies), advertisements, and in-theater announcements. The film's title derives from the U.S. film industry term "grindhouse", which refers to (now mostly defunct) movie theaters specializing in B movies, often exploitation films, shown in a multiple-feature format. The film stars Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews, Fergie, Bruce Willis, Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and stuntwoman Zoë Bell, who plays herself.
Rodriguez's segment, ''Planet Terror'', revolves around an outfit of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of zombie-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit, while Tarantino's segment, ''Death Proof'', focuses on a misogynistic, psychopathic stuntman who targets young women, murdering them with his "death proof" stunt car. Each feature is preceded by faux trailers of exploitation films in other genres that were developed by other directors.
After the film was released on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In much of the rest of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on ''Grindhouse'''s fake trailers: ''Machete'', ''Machete Kills'' and ''Hobo with a Shotgun''.
In a rural town in Texas, go-go dancer Cherry Darling decides to quit her low-paying job and find another use for her numerous "useless" talents. She runs into mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray at the Bone Shack, a restaurant owned by J. T. Hague. Meanwhile, a group of military officials, led by the demented Lt. Muldoon, are making a business transaction with a scientist named Abby for mass quantities of a deadly biochemical agent known as DC2 (codename "Project Terror"). Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply on hand and attempts to take him hostage. Abby intentionally releases the gas into the air. The gas reaches the town and turns its residents into deformed bloodthirsty, man-eating psychopaths, mockingly referred to as "sickos" by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block and his abused, neglected anesthesiologist wife Dakota at a local hospital. As the patients quickly become enraged aggressors, Cherry and El Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night, struggling to find safety.

Before each segment, there are trailers advertising fake films, as well as vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for ''Grindhouse''. "I didn't even know about it until I read it in the trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made ''Machete''. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down.
Rodriguez wrote ''Machete'' in 1993 as a full feature for Danny Trejo. "I had cast him in ''Desperado'' and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it." The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, ''Machete Kills'' (2013), followed.
Rob Zombie's contribution, ''Werewolf Women of the SS'', starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu; Udo Kier as Franz Hess, the commandant of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, Sheri; and Sybil Danning as SS officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers Test (wrestler)|Andrew "Test" Martin and Vladimir Kozlov|Oleg "Vladimir Kozlov" Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, "Basically, I had two ideas. It was either going to be a Nazi movie or a Women in prison film|women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like ''Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS''; ''Fräulein Devil''; and ''Love Camp 7''-I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." Zombie is also quoted as saying "I was getting very conceptual in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach."
Edgar Wright's contribution, ''Don't'', was produced in the style of a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer.
Eli Roth's contribution is a promo for the slasher opus ''Thanksgiving''. Produced in the style of holiday-themed slasher films like ''Halloween'', ''Silent Night, Deadly Night'', ''April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day'' and ''My Bloody Valentine'', the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim; Jordan Ladd, Jay Hernandez, and Roth himself as his intended victims; and Michael Biehn as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in ''Thanksgiving'' was based on a ''Mad'' magazine slasher parody titled ''Arbor Day''. Excerpts of the score from ''Creepshow'' were used in the faux trailer.
According to Roth, "My friend Jeff, who plays the killer pilgrim - we grew up in Massachusetts, we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the Thanksgiving slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's in love with a turkey, and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental institution and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'" "Shooting the trailer was so much fun," Roth has stated, "because every shot is a money shot. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd. It's just so wrong and sick that it's right."
Roth's fake trailer contained elements that almost earned ''Grindhouse'' an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting stabbed in the vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But we had a great discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it." Roth confirmed in an interview with Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg that he and co-writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film.
Some screenings of ''Grindhouse'' (mainly in Canada) also featured a fake trailer for a film titled ''Hobo with a Shotgun''. The trailer, created by Dartmouth, Nova Scotia filmmakers Jason Eisener, John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, won Robert Rodriguez's South by Southwest ''Grindhouse'' trailers contest. In the trailer, David Brunt plays a vagabond with a 20-gauge shotgun (changed to a 12-gauge for the actual movie) who becomes a vigilante. In the trailer, he is shown killing numerous persons, ranging from armed robbers to corrupt cops to a pedophilic Santa Claus. The trailer was available in certain selected movie theaters in the United States and Canada.
In 2010, the trailer was made into a Hobo with a Shotgun|full-length feature film starring Rutger Hauer as the hobo, with David Brunt playing a dirty cop. April 1, 2011 on American Video On Demand and May 6, 2011 in U.S. theatres.
'' sparked the idea for ''Grindhouse''.
The idea for ''Grindhouse'' came to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino when Tarantino set up screenings of double features in his house, complete with trailers before and in between the films. During one screening in 2003, Rodriguez noticed that he owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films ''Dragstrip Girl'' and ''Rock All Night.''
The film's name originates from the American term for theaters that played "all the exploitation genres: kung fu, horror, Giallo, sexploitation, the 'good old boy' redneck car-chase movies, blaxploitation, spaghetti Westerns-all those risible genres that were released in the 70s."
Rodriguez first came up with the idea for ''Planet Terror'' during the production of ''The Faculty'': "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they'd been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [a script] I'd started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [movie] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for ''Grindhouse.''
As ''Planet Terror'' took shape, Tarantino developed the story for ''Death Proof'', based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would "death-proof" their cars. As long as they were driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60 mph (97 km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his "death-proof" car. Tarantino remembers, "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of Women in prison films|women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized-let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you."
According to Rodriguez, "[Tarantino] had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started to tell me the story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it ''Death Proof.''' I helped title the movie, but that's it." Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, "Computer-generated imagery|CGI for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me-how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92-to me, the last terrific car chase was in ''Terminator 2''. And ''Final Destination 2'' had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action."
According to actress Marley Shelton, "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, at least ''Planet Terror''. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and adjustments to our performances and he changed lines every once in a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on ''Planet Terror'' and vice versa for ''Death Proof''. So it's really both of their brainchild." Tarantino has stated, "I can't imagine doing ''Grindhouse'' with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it."
Many of the cast members had previously worked with both directors. Before appearing in ''Grindhouse'', Marley Shelton had auditioned for ''The Faculty'', but Rodriguez chose not to cast her. She was eventually cast in the role of a customer in the opening sequence of ''Sin City''. Bruce Willis had appeared in both Tarantino's ''Pulp Fiction'' and Rodriguez's ''Sin City'', in addition to having a cameo appearance in a segment Tarantino directed for the anthology film ''Four Rooms''. Tom Savini had previously acted in ''From Dusk Till Dawn'', which was written by Tarantino and directed by Rodriguez. Michael Parks reprises the role of Earl McGraw in ''Planet Terror'' and ''Death Proof''. Parks first portrayed the role in ''From Dusk Till Dawn''. His son, James, appears in ''Death Proof'' as Edgar McGraw, a character that first appeared in ''From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money''. The first time the two characters appeared together was in Tarantino's ''Kill Bill''. Tarantino himself plays small roles in both segments of ''Grindhouse'', and director Eli Roth, who contributed the fake trailer ''Thanksgiving'' and whose film ''Hostel'' was produced by Tarantino, has a cameo in ''Death Proof''.
Tarantino attempted to cast both Kal Penn in ''Death Proof'', but both were unable to work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he decided to cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because "for people of my generation, he's a true hero...but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. When I open the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in ''Dreamer,''' or 'Kurt Russell in ''Miracle'',' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?"
Rodriguez and Tarantino each acted as cinematographer on their segments. Although Rodriguez had previously worked as the cinematographer on six of his own feature films, ''Death Proof'' marked Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer. The director of photography for Rob Zombie's fake trailer ''Werewolf Women of the SS'' was Phil Parmet, whom Zombie had first worked with on ''The Devil's Rejects''. The director of photography for Eli Roth's fake trailer ''Thanksgiving'' was Milan Chadima, whom Roth had previously worked with on ''Hostel''.
Though set in the modern day, the film uses various unconventional techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in ''Planet Terror'', five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.
''Planet Terror'' makes heavy use of digital effects throughout the film. Perhaps the most notable effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots and replaced it with computer-generated props-first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.
During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea of inserting "missing reels" into the film. "[Quentin] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," Rodriguez recalls, "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we've got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway."
On the editing of ''Death Proof'', Tarantino stated "There is half-an-hour's difference between my ''Death Proof'' and what is playing in ''Grindhouse''. [...] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down almost to the point of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked." An extended, 127-minute version of ''Death Proof'' was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival. Tarantino is quoted as saying "It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see ''Death Proof'' unfiltered. [...] It will be the first time everyone sees ''Death Proof'' by itself, including me."
''Grindhouse'' is rated PG-Rating|R in the United States for "strong graphic bloody violence and gore, pervasive language, some sexuality, nudity, and drug use". On March 15, 2007, ''The New York Post'' reported that the film would possibly require heavy and extensive cuts in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.
The music for ''Planet Terror'' was composed by Rodriguez. Inspiration for his score came from John Carpenter, whose music was often played on set. A cover version of the Dead Kennedys' "Too Drunk to Fuck" performed by Nouvelle Vague was also featured. The soundtrack for ''Death Proof'' consists entirely of non-original music, including excerpts from the scores of other films. Soundtrack albums for both segments were released on April 3, 2007.
''Grindhouse'' did not perform well at the box office,
The opening weekend box office total stood below not only the second weekends of ''Blades of Glory'' and ''Meet the Robinsons'', but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the widely panned ''Are We Done Yet?''. In an attempt to explain the film's disappointing opening weekend, box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that ''Grindhouse'' "suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted ''Snakes on a Plane'' and ''Slither'' among others: too funny to be scary, too scary to be funny." Box office analyst Lee Tistaert of tracking website Lee's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino's ''Kill Bill'' saga had been released as one film, instead of two separate volumes. "Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time as a result of two back-to-back $60 million grosses?" he asked. Others attributed the film's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend, noting that the weekend is more tailored for family-oriented films or light-comedy, not exploitative horror films. The film's length-running more than three hours-also hurt, keeping away casual theater-goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day.
Quentin Tarantino was quoted as saying about the film's box office results, "It was disappointing, yeah. But the movie worked with the audience. [...] People who saw it loved it and applauded. [...] I'm proud of my flop." Harvey Weinstein said that he was so "incredibly disappointed" with the film's opening weekend that he was considering re-releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back the "missing" scenes.
''Grindhouse'' was separated and released internationally. ''Death Proof'' grossed $30,663,961, while ''Planet Terror'' grossed $10,871,224., bringing ''Grindhouse'''s total gross to $67,000,000.
''Grindhouse'' was embraced by critics; review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 83% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 191 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Grindhouse'' delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache, improving upon its source material with feral intelligence."
''Entertainment Weekly'' awarded the film a "B+" rating, praising it as a "crazily funny and exciting tribute to the grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films" that "will leave you laughing, gasping, thrilled at a movie that knows, at long last, how to put the bad back in badass."
The critics who did not like the film were not amused by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of ''San Antonio Express-News'' noting that "this ambitious, scratched and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses."
Critics generally enjoyed the fake trailers. Geoff Pevere of the ''Toronto Star'' wrote that the use of the trailers helps the film establish "its credibility as both mock-artifact and geeky fetish object even before the opening feature."
The double feature appeared at number six on Jack Mathews and Owen Gleiberman's respective top ten lists for ''New York Daily News'' and ''Entertainment Weekly'', and at number seven on Stephanie Zacharek's list for ''Salon.com|Salon''. Marc Savlov listed ''Death Proof'' at number ten on his list for ''The Austin Chronicle''.
Outside the US and Canada, ''Planet Terror'' and ''Death Proof'' were released separately in extended versions, approximately two months apart.
In reaction to the possibility of a split in a foreign release, Tarantino stated "Especially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they don't really have this tradition ... not only do they not really know what a grind house is, they don't even have the double feature tradition. So you are kind of trying to teach us something else."
In the United Kingdom, ''Death Proof'' was released on September 21, 2007. In South America, ''Planet Terror'' was released in January 2010, while Death Proof was released in July 2010 at least in Brazil.
''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'' were released separately on DVD in the United States. The trailers were omitted from ''Death Proof'', with the exception of ''Machete'' which was from ''Planet Terror''. ''Death Proof'' was released on September 18, 2007, with ''Planet Terror'' following on October 16, 2007. Both were two-disc special editions featuring extended versions of the films.
''Planet Terror'' and ''Death Proof'' were released individually on Blu-ray Disc on December 16, 2008 in North America. The Blu-ray edition of ''Planet Terror'' also contained a "scratch-free" version of the film that removed much of the damage effects,
A two-disc Blu-ray "Special Edition" of ''Grindhouse'' was released on October 5, 2010 in the US by Vivendi Entertainment and has exclusive bonus features. This release marks the first time that US viewers can view the full ''Grindhouse'' "Double Feature Presentation" experience at home as it was originally released in theaters. The first disc of the 2-disc set contains ''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'', along with the faux trailers, including the "trailer" for ''Machete''. The theatrical cut was released on DVD in Canada from Alliance Atlantis. All of the extras from the previous individual DVD releases were included, however none of the extras from the Special Edition Blu-ray were included.
Bill Moseley stated at FanExpo on August 27, 2010 that the Blu-ray would also include a 5-minute version of ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.
In 2010, Rodriguez wrote and co-directed a feature-length adaptation of his fake trailer, ''Machete''. Many of the original actors from the trailer returned to their roles for it. ''Machete'' screened September 1 at the Venice Film Festival and was released across cinemas in the US on September 3, 2010.
''Machete'' turned out to be more of a success at the box office than ''Grindhouse'', grossing $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: ''Machete Kills'' and ''Machete Kills Again''. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.
The director of a trailer that played in some theaters in the United States and Canada (mainly the latter), ''Hobo with a Shotgun'', Jason Eisener, also made a feature-length adaptation of it. Rutger Hauer replaced Dave Brunt as the titular character, though Brunt does make a cameo as a corrupt cop.
These two adaptations received mainly positive reviews, with the general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although ''Hobo with a Shotgun'' was not as big a box office success in the U.S. as it was in Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.
Many of the other fake trailer directors have expressed interest in making their trailers into real films, including Edgar Wright and Eli Roth.
Both Rodriguez and Tarantino have said that they are interested in making a sequel to ''Grindhouse''.
Electra and Elise Avellan, Rodriguez's nieces who play the Crazy Babysitter Twins in both films, originally stated their uncle wanted to do a sequel featuring both ''Machete'' and ''The Babysitter Twins'', but the latter concept did not materialize with the former's release. "Robert mentioned something about the end of the world and Hollywood action films, where we'd be trained in Mexico to come back here and fight," Electra Avellan told bloody-disgusting.com.
A third feature-length film based on the trailers, the Robert Rodriguez-directed ''Machete Kills'', was released at the end of 2013.

'''''Undead or Alive: A Zombedy''''' is a 2007 comedy horror|comedy-horror film of the Western genre. Directed by Glasgow Phillips, and written by Phillips and Scott Pourroy,
Before his capture, Geronimo had cursed white men, causing people to become zombies. Later, at a house in a small town a man named Ben Goodman (Brian Posehn) acts suspiciously and attacks and eats his wife and daughter's brains.
Luke (Chris Kattan), a cowboy living in the town, plans to marry a saloon girl. On arriving at the saloon to propose to her, he encounters Elmer Winslow (James Denton), who has just arrived in town, and discovers that his "princess" is a prostitute. He picks a fight with Elmer until Sheriff Claypool (Matt Besser), who owns the saloon, jails them and steals $500 which Elmer is carrying. In the adjacent cell is Ben, awaiting his hanging the next morning. Elmer and Luke escape and lock Deputy Cletus (Chris Coppola) in the cell, where he is bitten by Ben.
Luke and Elmer find the sheriff and the prostitute having sex. They steal all the sheriff's money and make a getaway. When the sheriff releases Cletus from the cell he is bitten by him. The next morning hang Ben and assemble a posse to pursue the two fugitives.
Luke and Elmer are ambushed in their sleep by Sue (Navi Rawat), Geronimo's niece who was kidnapped and taken to New York to be educated and has now returned to take her revenge on the soldiers who killed her uncle. After a difficult start they become friends, despite Elmer revealing that he is an army deserter. Sheriff Claypool and Cletus, now zombies, attack the other members of the posse, who also become zombies. They are ambushed by Elmer, Luke and Sue, who realise they cannot be killed and flee.
Meanwhile, the townspeople cut Ben down from the gallows, not realising that hanging cannot "kill" him. He attacks the townspeople. The town's minister (Leslie Jordan) manages to escape by locking himself in an upstairs room at the saloon, now besieged by a horde of zombies. The following morning he climbs out of the window to get water, but is pursued by zombies and bitten by the prostitute.
Elmer, Luke and Sue are captured by soldiers, former colleagues of Elmer's (his $500 is revealed to have been won from them while gambling), who take them to their fort on the edge of the Grand Canyon. There they discover that the posse has arrived first and turned all the garrison into zombies, who attack the party and also turn all the other soldiers into zombies. They discover they can kill the zombies by decapitation.
During the night, while hiding in the fort, Sue reveals that the only way to be cured of the zombie curse is to eat the living flesh of the medicine man who created the curse. They shoot several cookware objects out of a homemade blunderbuss at the sheriff and the zombies to no avail. Elmer tries to punch First Sergeant Kermit in the mouth, but gets bitten by him. After destroying most of the zombies by blowing up the magazine, he becomes a zombie and throws Cletus off the cliff, before biting Luke.
Sue kills Sheriff Claypool, but is then attacked by Elmer and Luke. The next scene shows Elmer and Luke looking normal again, after having eaten Sue's flesh. The "eating the living flesh" cure apparently also works for relatives of the person who created the curse. Sue apparently tasted like gingerbread. The duo ride off into the sunset as Cletus stands up and chases them.
An epilogue shows Ben digging up his family, now zombies themselves, from the cemetery and the three of them (with their dog) skipping into town.

'''''Zombies Anonymous''''' (originally '''''Last Rites of the Dead''''') is a horror/comedy zombie film released in 2006, starring Gina Ramsden and Joshua Nelson. It was written and directed by Marc Fratto and produced by New York production company Insane-o-rama productions.
An unexplained zombie plague breaks out, causing the recently deceased to continue walking the earth. Despite being undead, the zombies retain all of their senses and wits, including the ability to speak and think rationally. The only way to kill a zombie is to completely destroy the brain, preferably with shotgun or explosives. An international crisis develops and the world breaks up into several camps, including anti zombie militants, and zombie sympathizers.
On the first night of the outbreak, a young woman named Angela (Gina Ramsden) is shot in the head by her jealous boyfriend Josh (Joshua Nelson), turning her into one of the walking dead. 
A few months later, as the world poorly adjusts to this new reality, Angela finds herself alone, depressed and suppressing a deep urge to eat human flesh.   She is attacked on the street by zombie hating strangers;  fired from her job by her boss (Sally Pressman) after a co-worker complains about her smell and appearance; she even begins to cover herself in a special brand of make-up for zombies called "Look-Alive". She finds comfort in a passive zombie support group called "Hugs for the Mortally Challenged" where she confesses her shame in being a zombie.
Meanwhile, Josh and his friends, Richie (J. Scott Green), Peter "Gooch" Guccione (Gaetano Iacono) and Malcolm (Constantine Josiah Taylor) join a radical zombie hate group, run by a ruthless army brat known only as The Commandant (Christa McNamee) where they commit several violent acts against zombies.
Josh, who still has feelings for Angela, hesitates in telling the Commandant, or his friends, about his undead ex-girlfriend. Josh and Angela have several run-in's as he calls her, stalks her, and openly expresses his love for her, much to her horror. Angela, in the meantime, finds herself being courted by one of the more outspoken members of her support group, Louis (Kevin Collins). Louis ultimately brings Angela into a new, far more radical cult of zombies who advocate zombie pride and practice the eating of human flesh. This cult is led by a zombie flower child named The Good Mother Solstice (Mary Jo Verruto), and appears to be responsible for acts of domestic terrorism. An early clash between the cult and the Commandant's army leaves several zombies as well as Richie dead. Angela survives the assault by hiding, but, in a moment of weakness, she devours the entrails of a disemboweled girl before she flees.
Ultimately, Josh breaks down and leads the Commandant to Angela's "Hugs for the Mortally Challenged" group, and most of them are taken out to the woods and beheaded. Angela is rescued by the Good Mother Solstice and her army of undead terrorists. Most of the Commandant's army is killed in the ensuing battle, although the Commandant and Malcolm escape unharmed. Josh escapes, only to realize he has been shot and is now one of the walking dead.
Angela awakens to find herself in Solstice's compound, where she is tied to the floor, drugged with a euphoria inducing concoction of liquified human flesh, and nearly brainwashed by Solstice and her chanting zombies. At the same time, the Commandant, distraught at losing her army, finds Josh and Malcolm, asking for their help in seeking revenge. When Malcolm refuses, he is shot dead. Josh agrees and calls Angela, luring the Good Mother Solstice and her army to his house.
The Commandant, who appears to be suffering from a nervous breakdown, disguises herself by chopping off her hair and dying it blonde. She shoots herself in the head, turning herself into one of the undead and poses as a victim of her own anti-zombie group.  She is eventually taken into Solstice's compound where she wreaks havoc. Josh follows her there, and sets off to kill Angela. As the Commandant fights her way through Solstice's zombie army, and Josh struggles to fight his way into the compound, Angela escapes from her bonds and battles with the Good Mother Solstice eventually injecting her with a full dose of her liquid flesh concoction, causing an overdose with messy results. Commandant ultimately kills most of Solstice's army, but not before being disemboweled and left partially paralyzed. Josh and Angela battle, and Angela blows Josh's leg off with a shotgun and castrates him.  Angela leaves, with Josh still professing his love for her. The Commandant turns up and blows Josh's head off with her shotgun, and then turns the gun on herself.
Angela returns to her home,  finds her LookAlive makeup has run off, leaving her pale zombie flesh exposed. She discards the rest of her LookAlive makeup and smiles.
The film was first premiered to the public under its original title of '''''Last Rites of the Dead''''' at the NYC Horror Film Festival in October 2006 where it won for best screenplay (Marc Fratto) and best actress (Gina Ramsden).

'''''L.A. Zombie''''' is a 2010 zombie horror film written and directed by Bruce LaBruce."", ''QuietEarth.us''. Retrieved on August 8, 2009. It premiered in competition at Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland in 2010. The film exists in two versions, a 63-minute cut version showcased at various festivals and theatres and a 103-minute directors cut DVD release containing hardcore gay pornography not seen in the cut version.
An extraterrestrial zombie (who may just be a schizophrenic vagrant, and whose appearance constantly shifts between that of a corpse, a tusked beast with irregular genitals, and a normal man) emerges from the sea, and begins making its way to Los Angeles. A motorist notices the zombie walking along a deserted road, picks it up, and dies in an accident moments later. The zombie recovers from the crash, and reanimates the driver by penetrating a wound in the man's chest with its monstrous penis. The ghouls have sex, which ends with the first zombie ejaculating black semen, and stumbling away as the motorist sits among the wreckage of his vehicle, in awe of what had just transpired.
The zombie reaches Los Angeles, and after perusing shopping carts full of discarded objects, ventures to the L.A. River, where it sees White-collar crime|a white collar criminal being shot to death by his partner. The zombie drags the deceased lawbreaker to a soiled mattress, and resurrects him via coitus with the bullet wounds in the man's back. The undead criminal and the zombie have sex, which is followed by the zombie wandering away, washing itself, and going to a Coffeehouse|café, where it purchases a cup of coffee.
The zombie steals some clothing, and finds the dumped body of a gang member who was shot in the head. The zombie brings the hood back to life by molesting the hole in his forehead, and has sex with him. A group of homeless are then shown meeting at an abandoned sofa, but flee when they discover the body of a fellow bum who had overdosed in a cardboard box. The zombie stumbles upon the scene, and after ignoring a homeless man who is merely passed out, resurrects and engages in sex with the dead one.
In a BDSM dungeon, four men have an orgy, and later all of them are killed by a pair of drug dealers when they refuse to pay for low-quality cocaine. The zombie witnesses the massacre through a window, enters the building, and instigates a gory circle jerk after bringing back the shot leathermen. The zombie then goes to a cemetery, cries tears and blood as it reminisces about its lovers, and digs up a grave as it begins to storm.

''Fangoria'' referred to ''L.A. Zombie'' as a, "strangely introspective indie film," and concluded that it was well done and thoughtful, and that "The joy of the film is that it doesn't do what you expect it to, yet it always seems sincere". According to ''Variety'', rather than combining art-show, campy horror, and porn movies, Labruce, "just turned out a confused mess," and, "it's hard to imagine regular filmgoers being especially disturbed...only the most sheltered viewers will feel the notoriety is deserved."Weissberg, Jay (August 6, 2010). "", ''Variety.com''. Accessed December 28, 2014.
A score of two stars out of five was awarded by Moria, which wrote "One suspects the true purpose behind ''L.A. Zombie'' is that Bruce LaBruce is less a pornographic filmmaker than a gleeful agitator who latches onto pornography solely for its outrage value".

'''''Two Evil Eyes''''' (Italian: '''''Due occhi diabolici''''') is a 1990 horror film, written and directed by Dario Argento and George A. Romero. The two had previously worked together on the immensely popular ''Dawn of the Dead'' in 1978. The film is split into two separate tales, both based largely on the works of Edgar Allan Poe: "The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar", directed by Romero and starring Adrienne Barbeau, showcases his traditional mix of horror with social commentary, especially capitalism; and "The Black Cat", directed by Argento and starring Harvey Keitel, which blends a number of Poe references into a new narrative. Both of the tales were filmed in and take place in contemporary Pittsburgh.
Jessica Valdemar, an attractive 40-year-old woman, rides in a taxi to the downtown Pittsburgh office of Steven Pike, her elderly husband's lawyer with some paperwork for Mr. Pike approval. Pike sees that Jessica's 65-year-old husband named Ernest Valdemar, who is dying from an unnamed terminal illness, is liquidating a number of his assets for cash and suspects Jessica of having undue influence on him. Jessica denies the allegations that she's any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone call to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agrees to let Jessica have access to the money, but warns her that if anything were to happen to Mr. Valdemar within the next three weeks before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.
Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate by hypnotizing him and having him do what they wish from his deathbed.  Jessica doesn't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $300,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.
The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking the body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that his soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Valdemar tells them that he sees "others" in the dark void looking at him. While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the "others" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of "the others" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keeps on coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.
Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free him from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. "They're with you now!" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house. Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. But then, the ghostly "Others" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body.
Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a "strange smell" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, telling him that there is nobody to wake him up.
Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: "still life's my art," a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities-led by Detective LeGrand-to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives.
After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel's relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel's talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life.
Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel's excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat's apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled ''Metropolitan Horrors'', a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures. As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he is executed for the murder of the cat.
One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod, who at that very moment is in a local bar drinking heavily. Rod becomes unnerved when the barmaid Eleanora gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel's own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome and gory death when Rod hacks her to death with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong.
Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel's disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons.  But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, he confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about his suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel's friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask of her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump.
The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel's whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod is not fazed by their questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls. Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall of that he put up is torn down and his crime scene is finally revealed. It reveals that the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel's tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. Not to be outdone, Rod grabs the pickaxe from LeGrand's partner and in seconds kills both policemen.  But handcuffed and in a panic, Rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after nearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. Rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. But his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck, killing him. The black cat makes a final appearance, and stares at the fate Rod had coming for him.
Romero collaborator Tom Savini provides the film's special Prosthetic makeup|make-up and gore effects, and appears briefly in "The Black Cat" episode playing a serial killer who looks like Edgar Allan Poe himself.
It was Julie Benz's first acting role and the first feature film she starred in. Her role in the movie is small as a teenage violin student in a few scenes in "The Black Cat" episode. Benz's voice was dubbed in the Italian-language version of the film by Dario Argento's daughter, Asia.

'''''King of the Zombies''''' is a 1941 American horror comedy film directed by Jean Yarbrough and stars Dick Purcell, Joan Woodbury and Mantan Moreland. The film was produced by Monogram Pictures, and was typical of its B-movie|B films churned out by the Pine-Thomas Productions|Pine-Thomas team. Along with flying scenes, the use of zany characters and slapstick efforts were juxtaposed with a spy and zombie story.Weaver 1993, pp. 36-45.
In 1941, a Capelis XC-12 transport aircraft flown by pilot James "Mac" McCarthy (Dick Purcell) flying between Cuba and Puerto Rico runs low on fuel and is blown off course by a storm. McCarthy, unable to pick up any radio transmissions over the Caribbean, hears by a faint radio signal. After crash-landing on a remote island, his passenger Bill Summers (John Archer) and his black manservant/valet, Jefferson Jackson (Mantan Moreland) take refuge in a mansion owned by Dr. Miklos Sangre (Henry Victor) and his wife Alyce (Patricia Stacey).
The quick-witted yet easily frightened manservant soon becomes convinced the mansion is haunted by zombies, and confirms this with some of the doctor's hired help. With the help of Barbara Winslow (Joan Woodbury), the stranded group begins to find out what mysterious events are taking place in the mansion.
Exploring, the group stumbles upon a Haitian Vodou#Myths and misconceptions|voodoo ritual in the cellar. It is being conducted by the doctor, who is in reality a foreign spy, trying to acquire war intelligence from a captured US Admiral whose aircraft had crashed in a similar fashion on the island. McCarthy comes under the doctor's spell but Summers comes to his aid. Information is being transmitted to Barbara, but Summers stops the ritual. The interruption causes the zombies to turn on their master. Sangre shoots the pilot but falls into a firepit and dies. With Sangre dead, all the zombies are released from the doctor's spell.

''King of the Zombies'' was announced in January 1941 as a vehicle for Bela Lugosi."Of local origin
''The New York Times'', January 27, 1941, p. 11. It was inspired by the success of ''The Ghost Breakers'' (1940).
Lugosi was meant to play the role of Dr. Miklos Sangre.Dendle 2001, pp. 96-97. When he became unavailable, negotiations ensued to obtain Peter Lorre for the part, but a deal could not be reached.Schallert, Edwin. "Robinson, Ida Lupino chosen for 'Sea Beast': Award winner assigned Hepburn return imminent 'Cracked Nuts' cast set Sanders to act Nazi cop Lorre 'King of Zombies'." ''Los Angeles Times'', March 1, 1941, p. 12. Veteran character actor Henry Victor was signed just prior to the date of filming.Schallert, Edwin. "Disney, Goldwyn will coproduce fairy tale: Hayworth, Astaire duo Helen Parrish wins lead Autry subject revealed Purcell, Woodbury team Montgomery in dual role." ''Los Angeles Times'', March 28, 1941, p. 26.
Principal photography by Sterling Productions, Inc. began on March 28 and wrapped early April, 1941, primarily filmed on a studio back lot. ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: August 18, 2016. The transport aircraft used in ''King of the Zombies'' is the Capelis XC-12, built in 1933 by Capelis Safety Airplane Corporation of California. The aircraft was a 12-seat, low-wing cabin monoplane with two 525 hp Wright Cyclone engines. 
In the press kit for ''King of the Zombies'', Monogram advised exhibitors to sell "it along the same lines as Paramount's ''The Ghost Breakers'' (1940)." The Bob Hope horror/comedy was a runaway hit at the time.Hallenbeck 
Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle called ''King of the Zombies'' "... utterly absurd and delightful".  Bruce G. Hallenbeck, who wrote ''Comedy-Horror Films'', said that the film's politically incorrect humor comes off as innocent due to Moreland's delivery.
''King of the Zombies'' was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music (Music Score of a Dramatic Picture) (Edward Kay).
Two years later,''King of the Zombies'' was followed by a sequel, of sorts, called ''Revenge of the Zombies'' (1943) that included two of the original cast members. Mantan Moreland reprised his role as Jeff. Madame Sul-Te-Wan was cast as Mammy Beulah, the housekeeper.

'''''Re-Kill''''' is 2015 American horror film directed by Valeri Milev and written by Michael Hurst. as members of paramilitary group tasked with hunting down and destroying zombies after an outbreak.
A young girl returns home to find her parents missing and the house in disarray.  She sits down to watch television, and the news reveals that five years earlier, a zombie outbreak killed off 4.5 billion people worldwide, 10 million of which are from the United States.  After detonating a nuclear bomb over San Francisco and walling off New York City, the US declared the outbreak over and established a paramilitary force known as R-Division to hunt down and destroy the remaining zombies.  The girl watches a reality TV series called ''Re-Kill'' that broadcasts live footage of R-Division squads.  Commercials interrupt the show, showing attempts to repopulate the US and reassure the populace.
The show begins with a recap.  An embedded journalist accompanies a squad on a raid to New Orleans, which has had reports of zombie activity.  The squad is overrun, and only two people make it to a car: Alex Winston and the journalist.  When the journalist stops speaking coherently and moans uncontrollably, Winston realizes she is infected and shoots her.  The government promises that the situation is under control and clears out the zombies.  Winston is reassigned to Division 6, which includes new recruit Tom Falkirk, former thief Omar Hernandez, immigrant Nguyen, Rose Matthews, "Grizzly" Adams, conspiracy theorist Trent Parker, and the squad leader, Sarge.
Along with embedded journalists Jimmy and Bobby, Division 6 is sent to investigate reports of a family who are harboring reanimated members.  Sarge explains that the outbreak spread so far because people could not give up hope their loved ones could be saved.  After neutralizing the human resistance, the soldiers rescue prisoners kept chained up for zombie food.  One of the family members reveals that his sister, a zombie, is kept in the attic.  Before she can be put down, she bites Tom, who is mercy-killed to prevent him from turning into a zombie.  In interviews, Parker is dismissive of Tom's sacrifice, and Sarge says that it is a known risk of the job.
Division 6's next job is to investigate a truck suspected of carrying contraband.  When they finally stop the truck, they find it contains zombies.  Sarge uses a rocket-propelled grenade to clear out the zombies.  The truckers initially profess ignorance of their cargo but eventually confirm rumors of the Judas Project, a shadowy program rumored to be an experiment on the zombies trapped in New York City.  Parker believes it to be a secret military project, but Sarge is more concerned with the possibility of a second outbreak, which he believes is inevitable due to human nature.
In the forbidden areas of New York City known as The Zone, they discover dead scientists and zombies who seem more intelligent.  After an ambush, Omar insists that Parker was bit and demands they kill him.  Before they kill him, Parker opens fire on the squad, killing Adams.  Winston is wounded next, and he sacrifices himself with a grenade to allow the others to escape.  In a previously recorded interview, he describes his belief that the government has secretly organized an ark for eligible survivors; he posthumously wishes the squad well and hopes they are accepted there.  Deeper in the Zone, Hernandez is bitten and turns.
As the squad faces a horde of zombies, including Hernandez, a man who claims to be the last remaining member of the Judas Project leads them to safety.  He explains the project was designed to turn the zombies against each other, but it instead revealed an alpha zombie, nicknamed Elvis, capable of leading a zombie army.  Jimmy says the network's drones will pick up and broadcast his and Bobby's footage every two hours.  As they perform reconnaissance, Bobby dies, alerting the zombie army.  The squad flees, only to be overwhelmed by zombies and killed one-by-one.  As a special news report reveals zombie activity near the Zone and the start of a new outbreak, the young girl who was watching the program is revealed to have transformed into a zombie.  Elsewhere, in the ark, soldiers discuss having found groups of survivors.

Pat Torfe of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that although the film's premise of a zombie-hunting reality TV show is new, the components of the film have been done before.  Torfe said the commercials enhance the verisimilitude but break the flow of the film.

The Soundtrack featured songs from The Flow of Opinion and Jake McMurray.
''Variety'' wrote that the film borrowed "equally from George A. Romero and Joe Dante for its wit and politics", and that "fans exhausted with big-budget zombie movies will be refreshed" by the film.
''OC Weekly'' reviewer Matt Coker remarked, "How can one not love a film with 'undead', 'zombie"' and 'bastards' in the same title?", "barely" recommended the film, writing that as it acts as an "homage of sorts" to other low/no budget zombie films, and has "just enough humor and ironic stereotypes to make up for the poor acting, bad lighting and looooooong build up to the inevitable conclusion".

Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle called it a "fairly humorless and uncomplicated zombie invasion exercise" that is "derivative and unnecessary".

'''The House of Clocks''' (Italian: '''''La casa nel tempo''''') is a 1989 Italian horror film directed by Lucio Fulci, made initially for Italian TV, but released direct-to-video instead.
The story revolves around a wealthy older couple who are murdered during a robbery by three young perpetrators. The event results in a supernatural reversal of time, symbolized by the fast, counter-clockwise movement of hands on the house's many clocks. Eventually, this leads to the resurrection of the older couple, who subsequently seek to terrorize the three burglars.
An elderly couple, Victor (Paolo Paoloni) and Sarah (Bettine Milne), live in a rambling country house filled with clocks of all shapes and sizes. The couple's taciturn grounds man Peter (Al Cliver) is happy enough looking after the slavering pack of dogs the couple own. But the maid Maria (Carla Cassola) is becoming more and more suspicious of her sinister employers that they are hiding something. Sure enough, she discovers the dead bodies of a money-grabbing nephew (Paolo Bernardi) and his wife (Francesco De Rose) lying preserved in open coffins in the wine cellar. Maria is gorily killed by the elderly Sarah in the greenhouse the next morning while announcing her plans to quit.
Meanwhile, three hoodlums, Diana (Karina Huff), Tony (Keith Van Hoven) and Paul (Peter Hintz) are driving through the area and decide to rob the old couple's house after receiving a tip-off from a grocery store owner in a nearby town about the wealth it supposedly contains and the decrepitude of the owners. That evening, Diana cunningly talks her way into the household by pretending that her car has broken down nearby and asks to use the phone. Soon, the phone lines are cut by her male accomplices and they force entry through an open window. Their plans to rob the old couple go badly wrong when Peter intervenes with his shotgun. A bloodbath ensues with Sarah accidentally getting shot, Peter getting killed by Paul, and Victor attacks Tony, forcing Diana to shoot him dead. The young trio are horrified by this turn of events, but decide to bundle the bodies away in a cupboard.
At first the dazed criminals fail to notice what effect the mayhem has had on all the clocks in the house. Each clock stops at 8:00 PM, the exact time the couple were killed. When they do notice, they try to leave, but are trapped indoors by the Dobermans let loose to prowl the grounds. Stranger still, the clocks begin to move in reverse, first slowly, then faster. The three decide to relax in the house overnight, and they head off upstairs to smoke some joints. Diana and Tony get a little too drawn into it and start to make out with each other, and soon begin to have sex.
Paul, who is left out of the lovemaking, wonders dejectedly downstairs. He discovers the bloodstains on the dining room floor where the killings took place have disappeared, and then he sees the bodies lying back where they'd fallen. Before he can alert the others, Paul is shot by an unseen figure stalking the house. Hearing the gunshot, Diana and Tony quickly dress and rush downstairs and see the old couple reanimate and advance towards them. In the kitchen, Diana is trapped by the old woman who grabs a knife and stabs her through the hand, pinning her to the kitchen table. Sarah then retrieves a ring that Diana had stolen from her ring finger. Making a narrow escape, Diana and Tony find a severely wounded Paul in the cellar. (Note: illogical time distortions continue as Diana's hand heals up while Paul's injuries remain.) Diana and Tony escape from the cellar through a high window and emerge into the grounds. Paul is too injured to hoist himself up to the window and is axed to death by the vengefully reanimated Peter. As the couple run across the grounds, now in daylight with the clocks in full reverse, Tony is pulled into a shallow grave by the corpse of Maria, the maid. She kills him with a wooden stick though his stomach before heading off to confront the old couple. In the wine cellar, Maria confronts the elderly couple with murdering their nephew and his wife to remove them as their rightful heirs to the estate. Then, the niece and nephew finally revive and the old couple are killed again by their previous victims. Diana staggers away from the house.
Suddenly, Diana, Tony, and Paul awaken in their car outside the country house. Apparently all that happened to them was just a dream brought on with special intensity by the marijuana they've been smoking. Inside the house, the fully alive nephew and niece enjoy being alive again and are having their morning breakfast, with Maria the maid attending to them. The dead bodies of Victor and Sarah are in the wine cellar having been substituted for them.
Driving away from the house, Diana, Tony, and Paul remark on the astonishing similarities of their dreams of being at the house and time moving backwards. Suddenly, a dead cat they picked up on the road earlier suddenly revives and attacks them, forcing Tony, who's driving, to crash their car off a cliff and killing them all... again. Inexplicably, the car's clock and all the wristwatches on the bloodied and dead Diana, Tony, and Paul stop, and begin to roll backwards...
''The House of Clocks'' is one of four films made for the Italian cable TV series ''House of Doom''. Lucio Fulci himself would direct two films for the series (the first being ''The Sweet House of Horrors''). Director Umberto Lenzi would also direct two films (''House of Witchcraft'' and ''House of Lost Souls''). Unfortunately the finished films were deemed too violent by producers and were never aired. They were then relegated to a direct-to-video release.Shreik Show DVD Liner Notes, 2002.
Allmovie called the film "a credible addition to the director's oeuvre - sometimes reminiscent of ''Dolls'' or Pete Walker's creepy punishment gothics (''Frightmare'', ''House of Whipcord'', etc.) - and fans should give it a look".
Media-Blasters subsidiary Shriek Show would release the film for the first time ever in America in 2002.

'''''Fading of the Cries''''' is a 2010 American fantasy film written(original story) by Brian Metcalf and co-written by Steven Maguire and starring Brad Dourif, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Mackenzie Rosman and Elaine Hendrix.
Jacob is a young man who defends his town from evil forces, aided by a magic sword. He saves a girl called Sarah from a horde of the reanimated dead, and they escape through the floor of a church. An evil necromancer named Mathias confronts Sarah and demands an amulet given to her by her uncle before he died. Sarah refuses, and after threatening to unleash all the evils he can conjure, Mathias disappears.
In the morning, Sarah and Jacob return to Sarah's house through streets, fields, churches and underground tunnels, pursued by hordes of demonic creatures. They arrive around midday to find Mathias is already there, holding a sword to Sarah's little sister Jill's throat. Mathias threatens to kill Jill unless Sarah gives him the amulet. Sarah makes Mathias promise he will let Jill go, and gives him the amulet. Mathias disappears with both Jill and the necklace, and Sarah begs Jacob to go save Jill from Mathias. Jacob reluctantly agrees.
Jacob arrives at Sarah's dead uncle's house and fights Mathias. He manages to destroy the amulet, defeating Mathias, but Jill falls through a hole in the floor. Jacob dives after her and breaks her fall with his own body, unharmed himself because he cannot die due to a protection spell that Sarah's uncle cast before he died. They return to Jill's home. Her mother and her sister Sarah are dead, killed by the reanimated dead while Jacob was not there to protect them.
Jacob returns to Sarah's uncle's house to find Mathias reading through his necromancer spells, looking for a way to restore his power. Mathias laughs and boasts that he cannot be killed because he is already dead. Jacob says grimly that he is not there to kill Mathias; instead he will torture Mathias for all eternity. The movie fades out with Jacob repeatedly slashing Mathias with his sword and the sounds of Mathias's screams filling the air.

'''''Lifeforce''''' is a 1985 science fiction horror film directed by Tobe Hooper and written by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby, based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel, ''The Space Vampires''. Featuring Steve Railsback, Peter Firth, Frank Finlay, Mathilda May, and Patrick Stewart, the film portrays the events that unfold after a trio of humanoids in a state of suspended animation are brought to earth after being discovered, by the crew of a European space shuttle, in the hold of an alien space ship. The film received mixed to positive reviews, but was a box office bomb, failing to recoup its budget.
The crew of the space shuttle ''Churchill'' finds a 150-mile long spaceship hidden in the coma of Halley's Comet. The crew finds hundreds of dead, shrivelled bat-like creatures and three naked humanoid bodies (two male and one female) in suspended animation within glass containers. The crew recovers the three aliens and begins the return trip to Earth.
During the return journey, mission control loses contact with the shuttle and a rescue mission is launched to investigate. The rescuers discover that the ''Churchill'' has been severely damaged by fire, with its internal components destroyed, and the three containers bearing the aliens are all that remain intact. The aliens are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London where they are watched over by Dr. Leonard Bukovski (Gothard) and Dr. Hans Fallada (Finlay). Prior to an autopsy, the female alien (May) awakens and drains the "life force" out of a guard. The female alien then escapes the research facility and proceeds to drain various other humans of their life force, revealing an ability to Shapeshifting|shape-shift. It transpires that the aliens are from a race of space vampires that consume the life force of living beings, rather than their blood.
Meanwhile, in Texas, an escape pod from the ''Churchill'' is found, with Colonel Tom Carlsen (Railsback) inside. Carlsen is flown to London where he describes the course of events, culminating in the draining of the crew's life force. Carlsen explains that he set fire to the shuttle with the intention of saving Earth from the same fate and escaped in the pod. However, when he is hypnotized, it becomes clear that Carlsen possesses a psychic link to the female alien. Carlsen and SAS Col. Colin Caine (Firth) trace the alien to a psychiatric hospital in Yorkshire. While in Yorkshire, the two believe they have managed to trap the alien within the heavily sedated body of the hospital's manager, Dr Armstrong (Stewart); but Carlsen and Caine later learn that they were deceived, as the aliens had wanted to draw the pair out of London.
As Carlsen and Caine are transporting Dr Armstrong in a helicopter back to London, the alien girl breaks free from her sedated host and disappears. When they reach London a "plague" has overtaken the city and martial law has been declared. The two male vampires, previously thought destroyed, have escaped from confinement by shape-shifting into the soldiers guarding them; the pair then transform most of London's population into zombies. After their life force has been drained by the male vampires, the victims seek out other humans in order to absorb their life force, perpetuating the cycle. The absorbed life forces are channeled by the male vampires to the female vampire, who transmits the accumulated energy to their spaceship in Earth's orbit.
Fallada impales one of the male vampires with an ancient device of "leaded iron". Carlsen admits to Caine that, while on the shuttle, he felt compelled to open the female vampire's container and to share his life force with her. She is later found inside St. Paul's Cathedral, lying upon the altar, transferring the energy to her spaceship. She reveals, much to Carlsen's shock, that they are a part of each other due to the sharing of their life forces, thus their psychic bond.
Caine follows Carlsen into the cathedral and is intercepted by the second male vampire, whom he dispatches. Carlsen impales himself and the female alien simultaneously. The female vampire is only wounded and returns to her ship with Carlsen in tow, releasing a burst of energy that blows open the cupola dome of St. Paul's. The two ascend the column of energy to the spaceship, which then returns to its hiding place within the comet.

''Lifeforce'' was the first film of Tobe Hooper's three-picture deal with Cannon Films, following his enormous success with ''Poltergeist'' in 1982, which was a collaboration with producer Steven Spielberg. The other two films are the remake of ''Invaders from Mars'' and ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2''.
Filming began on February 2, 1984. Before Tobe Hooper was finally approved, Michael Winner, was offered the chance to direct the film. Retrieved 3 June 2015
The movie was originally filmed and promoted under the same title as the Colin Wilson novel. Cannon Films, which reportedly spent nearly $25 million in hopes of creating a blockbuster movie, disliked ''The Space Vampires'' for sounding too much like another of the studio's typical low budget exploitation films.Scapperotti, Dan. "The Hooper on Lifeforce," ''Cinefantastique''. Oak Park, Illinois, July 1985. As a result, the title was changed to ''Lifeforce'', referring to the spiritual energy the space vampires drain from their victims, and it was edited for its US theatrical release by TriStar Pictures into a 101-minute domestic cut that was partially re-scored by Michael Kamen, with a majority of Henry Mancini's original music remaining.
Though seldom recognized, ''Lifeforce'' is largely a remake of Hammer Films's ''Quatermass and the Pit (film)''/''Five Million Years to Earth''. In an interview, Tobe Hooper discussed how Cannon Films gave him $25 million, free-reign, and Wilson's book. Hooper then shares how giddy he was. "I thought I'd go back to my roots and make a 70 mm Hammer film." ''The Making of Lifeforce'' documentary (2013), by filmmakers Calum Waddel and Naomi Holwill, included on the ''Lifeforce'' Blu Ray, Scream FactoryMiller, Thomas Kent. ''Mars in the Movies: A History''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2016. ISBN 978-0-7864-9914-4.Migliore, Andrew and John Strysik. ''Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H.P. Lovecraft''. Portland: Nightshade Books, 2006
The screenplay was written by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Tobe Hooper came up with the idea of using Halley's Comet in the screenplay, rather than the asteroid belt as originally used in the novel, as the comet was going to pass by Earth one year following the film's release. The time settings were also changed from the mid-21st century to the present day.
Colin Wilson was unhappy with the way the film turned out. He wrote of it, "John Fowles had once told me that the film of ''The Magus'' was the worst movie ever made. After seeing ''Lifeforce'' I sent him a postcard telling him that I had gone one better."
The film marked the fourth project to feature special effects produced by Academy Award winner John Dykstra, who in 1986 was granted with the "Caixa Catalunya Award for Best Special Effects" in the Sitges Film Festival (located in Spain) for his special effects work in ''Lifeforce''.This award (presented annually) is the Special Effects Award attributed by the Sitges Film Festival, but its name has changed among years, depending on different sponsors. In 1986 it was called "''Premio Caixa Catalunya a los Mejores Efectos Especiales''" ("Caixa Catalunya Award for Best Special Effects") since that year the sponsor was Caixa Catalunya, a local bank. The umbrella-like alien spaceship was modelled after an artichoke, while the model London destroyed in the film was actually the remains of Tucktonia, a model village near Christchurch, United Kingdom, that had closed not long before the shooting of the film. It took a week to film the death scene of the pathologist played by Jerome Willis, and bodycasts of Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart and Aubrey Morris were made by make-up effects supervisor Nick Maley for their death scenes.
One effect near the end of the film involving the column of energy rising from the female alien through the top of St. Paul's Cathedral to the spacecraft was engineered by art director Tony Reading. A column of 3-M material was placed against black velvet and a crew member blew cigar smoke into its bottom. This image was then front projected onto a translucent projection screen behind the actors to create the energy column.
James Horner was first asked to write the film score before Henry Mancini was brought in and produced a score consisting of 90 minutes of an occasionally atonal and ambient music using the London Symphony Orchestra. Mancini had agreed to do the film based on the original concept of a 15-minute essentially dialogue-free opening sequence involving the discovery and exploration of the alien spacecraft and the moving of the three aliens back to the ''Churchill'', for which he composed a tonal "space ballet." As discussed below, this opening section was largely cut from the film.
For the US domestic cut version, Michael Kamen was approved to write the occasional alternative music cues that were partially re-scored and placed in at the last minute for some of the US domestic prints of the film.
The initial cut of ''Lifeforce'' as edited by Tobe Hooper was 128 mins long. This is 12 minutes longer than the final version which had several scenes cut, most of them taking place on the space shuttle ''Churchill''. According to Nicholas Ball, who played the main British astronaut, Derebridge, it was felt that there was too much material in outer space and so the majority of the ''Churchill'' scenes were deleted. Also, most of Nicholas Ball's performance ended up on the cutting room floor according to an interview he gave on the UK talk show ''Wogan'' in 1985.
According to interviews with Bill Malin, who plays one of the male vampires, the film went over schedule during production. Because of this some important scenes were never shot, and the film was shut down at one time because the studio had simply run out of money. Retrieved 1 January 2017
Despite being credited on the US domestic cut, the following actors were deleted from that cut of the film: John Woodnutt, John Forbes-Robertson (actor)|John Forbes-Robertson and Russell Sommers. The ''Churchill'' commanding officer Rawlins, played by Geoffrey Frederick, was British, but in post-production it was decided that Patrick Jordan would dub his voice. Also in the US version, some of Geoffrey Frederick's voiceover heard on the ''Churchill'' is dubbed.
The movie received mixed reviews from critics.
On the other hand, science-fiction film authority C. J Henderson praised the film: "''Lifeforce'' is an incredible film, and may by be the most intelligent vampire movie ever made ... [The ideas presented in ''Lifeforce''] are beyond [others vampire movies] beyond all of them, light-years beyond ... the story is what makes this movie hum.... ''Lifeforce'' is a true, thinking sci-fi fan's film."Henderson, C. J. ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies: From 1897 to the Present''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. While, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik in their ''Lurker in the Lobby'' explain that Colin Wilson wrote ''The Space Vampires'' as a consequence of H.P. Lovecraft's publisher August Derleth challenging Wilson (who was critical of Lovecraft's writing) to write a Lovecraftian novel himself (a challenge that resulted in three such novels, ''The Mind Parasites'', ''The Space Vampires'', and ''The Philosopher's Stone (novel)|The Philosopher's Stone''), and they continue, "[''Lifeforce''] is big, splashy, and ... the scenes of an apocalyptic London are not to be missed. And the film, an obvious tribute to Nigel Kneale's Quatermass, has deep roots in Lovecraft's mythos." 
As of Jan 26, 2017, it holds a 67% "Fresh" score on Rotten Tomatoes.
''Lifeforce'' was released on June 21, 1985 to negative box office returns. The film opened in fourth place, losing a head-to-head battle against Ron Howard's sci-fi film, ''Cocoon''. The film earned $11,603,545 at the US box office.
The first release on video in the UK was the heavily cut US 'Domestic cut'. The full 'International cut' was not available until it was released by MGM in 2000s. The U.S. saw the first release of the 'International cut' with MGM/UA's 1994 release of the Deluxe Widescreen Letterbox laserdisc.
Scream Factory announced they would be releasing ''Lifeforce'' on Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack on June 18, 2013. This release included the theatrical US version of the film as well as the International cut of the film.
Arrow Video released the movie as a Steelbook two-disc Blu-ray special edition in October, 2013 in the UK, with the same features as the US Blu-ray release.

'''''Hide and Creep''''' is an American horror/comedy film released in 2004. This film was based on an earlier short named '''''"Birthday Call"'''''. Both the film and the short were directed by Chuck Hartsell and Chance Shirley, and were written by Chance Shirley. The film was produced by Crewless Productions, an Alabama based independent production company.  ''Hide and Creep'' had its world premiere September 23, 2004 at the Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival in Birmingham, Alabama.
A southern town is simultaneously attacked by a UFO and zombies (a reference to ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'', although it is unclear whether or not the two are related or coincidental in this film). A government agent (played by John Walker) parachutes in to investigate reports of UFO sightings. Upon arriving, he finds zombies springing from the graveyard. He is killed by one of them (this zombie virus is contagious, spread by biting). From here, the movie splits into four main stories.
Three men must defend their hunting club from attacking zombies, which can only be killed by head wounds.  The men encounter the zombies outside their hunting lodge, but having neglected to bring any guns with them, they split up in the woods in an attempt to escape.  Two of the men make it back to their hunting lodge and begin firing on the zombies.  One of the men try to contact the sheriff's office, but the sheriff is out and they are advised by an agent from the Department of Home Land Defense to shoot the zombies in the head and avoid being bitten.  The third man is wounded and makes it back to the lodge after his two friends have dispatched the zombies.  His friends ask him what caused his wound and he claims he ran into a tree, when in fact he was bitten by a zombie. The men leave the woods to help defend the town. Eventually, the two non-infected friends are forced to kill the wounded man when he begins to show signs of infection. Lee, one of the remaining men, goes to a grocery store, where he is accused of being a zombie himself. The grocery store employees begin brutally beating him. His friend (Keith) walks by the store and witnesses what is happening to Lee, but is too late to stop it from happening. Assuming there was nothing he could do, Keith goes back to the nearby strip club. The strippers have been zombified and chase him out, but he learns they are afraid of the dark.  After calling the local radio station with this information, Keith returns to his house, which his two daughters have been left to defend all alone.  Keith takes his daughters and the secretary (Barbara from the police station) and her ex-boyfriend with him and they flee the town in Keith's SUV.  However, as they are leaving the town, Keith's youngest daughter states that she is hungry and wants something to eat.  Keith promises her they will get some food soon.  But she grabs Keith's hand and bites him, and the SUV careens off the road.
A man is found naked in the graveyard, looking for his car and girlfriend after being briefly abducted by aliens. He goes to the police station, where he is able to find a pair of pants, and meets up with a group of a couple other guys and the secretary of the police station. He and she go off into town, do very little, and ultimately ending up at the same house as the man in story 1.
The town's preacher is attacked by a zombie in his church and is forced to kill the zombie while sustaining a bite wound on his hand.  A worried woman asks him to give an impromptu sermon later in the day to comfort the people of the town.  The preacher then goes and looks for some alcohol to dull the pain in his hand.  However he lives in a dry county.  The preacher is forced to steal some liquor from a party being hosted by a pushy woman who borrowed folding chairs from him earlier in the day.  The woman tries to stop him but he bites her, and is then horrified by his newfound bloodlust.  Later, he gives his flock the requested sermon in the form of an angry rant.  He tells his flock that they should not expect the comfort and answers that they seek, when they can't even be bothered to attend regular services. Then he tells them that this is the end of the world, and he states he has no answers and shows them the wound on his hand.  A zombie walks in and then the preacher kills the zombie, protecting his flock when, yet again, they show themselves to be incapable or unwilling to act for themselves.  The preacher then asks God to forgive him and shoots himself in the head and splatters his blood on a woman of his congregation, and she screams.  This ends the preacher story thread.
The scene opens on Chuck sleeping on the floor of his store, "Chuck's Super Video World".  He is awakened by one of his customers banging on his front door trying to return a DVD because the drop-box has many anti-Hollywood pamphlets. The two men have a discussion about wide-screen vs. full-screen, and to make his customer happy, Chuck lets him have a free rental of the full-screen version of ''Citizen Kane''.
Chuck then hears something in the back of his store and goes to investigate the noise.  He finds nothing at first, but then a zombie grabs him and pulls him back into the store.  The zombie and Chuck fight briefly, and Chuck knocks out the zombie with a VCR to the head.  The VCR then ejects Chuck's missing copy of ''Night of the Living Dead''.
Chuck attempts to contact the chief of police but he is out of town, and the secretary asks him to call back on Monday when the chief returns.  Chuck then calls his mother and asks her how to get blood out of his T-shirt because he got blood on himself while fighting the zombie, and after she gives him a brief history of stain removal, she reveals that hydrogen peroxide works best.  Chuck tells his mother what happened and makes plans to dispose of the corpse.
  
Chuck loads the zombie into his truck and takes it to the police station and leaves it there with a post it note on the head with his name and number on it and instructions for the police chief to contact him on Monday when he gets back.
Chuck leaves to go to breakfast and becomes aggravated when the restaurant he chooses doesn't have any Coca-Cola|Coke but offers him Pepsi instead.  Chuck is next seen eating his breakfast as the character Chris sits down and starts talking to him about the corpse that Chuck left at the police station when Barbara, the secretary at the police station, calls looking for Chris.
The two men go to the cemetery to look for Barbara's car which was taken by the agent from the Dept of Homeland Defense.  They get to the cemetery and find the agent and Michael, and give them both a ride back to the police station.  Everyone decides to try to find Barbara's car while Chuck volunteers to stay behind in case someone calls the police station.
Chuck kills time by smoking some confiscated marijuana and waiting for the college football game to come on.  Chuck watches TV while waiting for the game to come on and is upset when the game is preempted for a news report about the zombies in town.  The newscaster then calls the police station and gets Chuck.  The newscaster assumes that Chuck is a cop, but Chuck corrects him and then asks the newscaster to put the game back on, but the newscaster is persistent and gets Chuck to talk about the zombies.  After telling what he knows about the zombies, Chuck again tries to get the newscaster to put the game back on; unfortunately it does not work, and the news broadcast continues.
Later Chuck finds out from a radio broadcast that the zombies are afraid of the dark and waits for night to fall before trying to make his escape.
Chuck is the last character seen alive and he is about to leave the police station to make a run for it, when he hears that the game is about to be broadcast.  Chuck checks his watch and sees that he has enough time to watch the game, and sits down to watch as the movie ends and the credits roll.
Birthday call, the short which inspired Hide and Creep, takes place in a basement (again, in Thorsby Alabama) besieged by a horde of zombies, where a man calls his friend to wish him a happy birthday only to later discover that his companion has been bitten.

'''''Trick 'r Treat''''' is a 2007 American-Canadian horror anthology film written and directed by Michael Dougherty.Trick 'r treat (2009) Directed by Michael Dougherty. Available at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862856/ .
 The film stars Dylan Baker, Brian Cox, Rochelle Aytes, Lauren Lee Smith, Leslie Bibb, and Anna Paquin. It centers on four Halloween-related horror stories. One common element that ties the stories together is the presence of Sam (Trick 'r Treat)|Sam, a mysterious child Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treater wearing shabby orange pajamas with a burlap sack over his head, who makes an appearance in all the stories whenever someone breaks Halloween traditions.
Despite being delayed for two years and having a small number of public screenings, the film received much critical acclaim and has since garnered a strong cult following. In October 2013, the filmmakers announced that a sequel, ''Trick 'r Treat 2'', is in the works. In 2016 Michael Dougherty and Legendary Pictures teamed up with AtmosFX to create a series of digital Halloween decorations that feature Sam.http://www.slashfilm.com/trick-r-treat-sequel-update/
In the fictional town of Warren Valley, Ohio, Emma (Leslie Bibb) and her Halloween-worshipping boyfriend Henry (Tahmoh Penikett), set up numerous ghost-scarecrows for Halloween in their yard, despite the fact that Emma hates Halloween. After returning home from a Halloween party, Emma tries to blow out a jack-o'-lantern, but Henry tells her not to because it is against tradition to extinguish a jack-o'-lantern on Halloween. She blows it out anyway while his back is turned. While Henry is drifting off to sleep inside the house, Emma attempts to take down the Halloween decorations without his knowing. In the process of doing so, she is murdered by an unknown assailant with a large blade shaped like a pumpkin lollipop.  This occurs in front of a group of kids who were trick-or-treating, causing them to run away in fright. Some time later, Henry goes outside to search for Emma but finds she is gone. He notices limbs hanging by wires outside. One of the decorative scarecrows lights up and he approaches it and takes down the cover.  He cries out in shock at the sight of Emma's severed head speared onto the stick and wrapped in decorative lights.  Her limbs have been chopped off and her mouth is stuffed with a large lollipop.
Steven Wilkins (Dylan Baker), the town's elementary school principal, spots his young neighbor Charlie (Brett Kelly) stealing candy from his yard after a trip of smashing jack-o'-lantern (noticing the remains of them on his shoes) as he returns from the store with more. Smiling and seemingly taking the offenses in stride, he places him down at his front door and talks to him about candy and stealing, explaining rules of etiquette and how to properly respect Halloween while carving out a jack-o'-lantern, offering him a chocolate bar in the middle of it. Charlie eats the chocolate bar, which turns out to be poisoned with cyanide, and throws up large amounts of chocolate and blood before he dies while Wilkins reminds him of another important rule of Halloween: "always check your candy". As Wilkins is trying to take Charlie's corpse to the backyard to bury it (getting blood on his shirt while he's at it), his doorbell rings. The trick-or-treaters, among them a small boy wearing a burlap sack hood over his head with buttons for eyes and stitching for a mouth, take their candy without finding out what Wilkins has done. Wilkins then dumps Charlie's body in a large hole dug in his back yard next to an equally large hole where another unknown child's body already lies, and has a brief run-in with his neighbor, Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox), and his dog Spite. After finishing the burial, Wilkins sees Kreeg screaming from his window, begging for help; Wilkins disregards this and Kreeg is knocked down by an unknown assailant. Later, Wilkins arrives in his basement, where he helps his son Billy carve a "jack-o'-lantern" in their basement, which is revealed to be Charlie's severed head. The sequence ends with Billy saying "But don't forget to help me with the eyes."
Four kids — Macy (Britt McKillip), Schrader (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), Sara (Isabelle Deluce), and Chip (Alberto Ghisi), the same trick-or-treaters who earlier visited Wilkins — meet up with a peer named Rhonda (Samm Todd) whom everyone considers a savant as they scour the neighborhood for jack-o-lanterns and ask for one of her own while also inviting her to come with them. Together, with Macy leading, they journey to the abandoned rock quarry while Rhonda talks briefly with Chip about the origins of Halloween and Sara asks why they're there as well as what the purpose of the jack-o-lanterns is. Macy tells them the local urban legend of "The Halloween School Bus Massacre".
Thirty years ago, in 1977, there was a group of supposed mentally challenged kids. Their parents were embarrassed by their conditions and saw them to be a burden to them, and as such, they were sent off to a school in another town so they would not face the townspeople's mocking. One day on Halloween, their parents, no longer able to stand the strain and humiliation of caring for them, paid the driver to put them out of their misery by driving the bus into the lake at the bottom of the rock quarry, intending to make it look like a horrible accident, so they would be freed of their burden. He drove the bus to the quarry, chained the kids to the seats, and while he was checking them, one boy managed to get free and went to the steering wheel, wanting to drive back home. However, he accidentally set the gear in forward instead of reverse before the driver could  stop him and drove it over the edge of the cliffside into the lake of the lake, drowning them all. The bus driver managed to get out alive and was never heard from again. Some say the school bus sank so deep it couldn't be found. Others say the town didn't want the school bus to be found. The eight jack-o-lanterns collected represent the eight souls lost that day and are meant to be left at the lakeside as an offering.
After the story, the group walk to a rickety elevator; Macy, Sara, and Schrader get in with their jack-o-lanterns to go down to the lake. Since the elevator will only hold three at a time, thus Chip and Rhonda wait for it to come back for them. Once it is their turn, they hear the panicked cries and screams of the other three on the way down and watch as the lights of their jack-o-lanterns go out in the mist. Rhonda has Chip stay in the elevator with the remaining jack-o-lanterns, saying that they will protect him, as she goes to investigate. Walking through the mist, she eventually comes to the wreckage of the half submerged school bus and sees the masks of the others floating in the water. She is suddenly attacked by two water-drenched figures covered in chains and runs to see a third in the midst of disemboweling Chip. As they chase her, Rhonda drops and accidentally steps on her glasses before tripping and hitting her head on a rock, knocking herself out. When she comes to, she sees the figures standing over her and cries out in fear, but one of them, actually Schrader in disguise, explains that it was just a prank played by all of them and tries to apologize for getting her hurt. The remorseless Macy kicks a jack-o'-lantern into the lake, where after as whispers and giggles suddenly echo out of the mist. After Schrader leads Rhonda to the elevator he hears the others screaming and thinks it is another attempt of Macy's at a cruel prank. However, when he meets up with them they all witness the figures of the real eight dead children rise out of the lake, still tied in their chains. The undead children chase the group and manage to grab hold of the chains which Sara is wearing as part of her costume, dragging her away to be killed before she can reach the elevator as the other three make it there. Meanwhile, Rhonda has locked herself in the elevator leading out of the quarry, looking sullen yet calm. Despite the others begging her to open it, she ignores them and rides it up herself, as the School Bus children corner them as revenge for the prank (and probably also for destroying the jack-o'-lantern which is breaking an important Halloween rule). As Rhonda steps out of the elevator and leaves the quarry, the other kids are heard being dismembered and eaten alive. Before Rhonda begins walking home with her jack-o-lantern filled wagon, she turns and notices the small boy in the orange footed pajamas and burlap sack mask and nods respectfully to him.
Laurie (Anna Paquin), a self-conscious 22-year-old virgin, is getting ready for Halloween with her older sister Danielle (Lauren Lee Smith) and their two friends Maria (Rochelle Aytes) and Janet (Moneca Delain) who try to boost her confidence by taking her to a party. The girls all dress in fairy tale costumes while Laurie is stuck as Little Red Riding Hood, a choice she feels uneasy with while her sister tells her "it's tradition". They walk through town on the way to the party picking up dates among the local men, but Laurie is uninterested (she is more into the traditional Trick or Treating). Annoyed by their talk about boys, she stays behind to enjoy the town festivities and plans to join back up with them later.
Meanwhile, a young woman makes out with a masked man in an alley. He affectionately kisses her neck but, when she looks down, she sees blood running down her body. The man smiles, revealing blood on his fangs; he is a vampire. The woman screams and makes her way to the street where the people are gathered for the parade who all ignore her, thinking she's just another drunk party-goer covered in make-up blood. The woman turns around to see the vampire standing behind her and screams as he swings his cloak over her. He leaves her dead body on the sidewalk leaning against a building, making it look like she's merely passed out, and walks away casually into the parading people.
Later, as Laurie walks down a dimly lit path in the woods, she senses someone is following her and calls out for whoever is nearby to show themselves as she is in no mood for games. When no one responds, she turns and comes face to face with the vampire. He grabs her by the neck and holds her against a tree, saying, "My, my, what big eyes you have", before biting her neck as she cries out in fright.
In the meantime, Maria, Janet, and all the other girls present are enjoying their party at a bonfire in the meadow (known as Sheep's Meadow) with the men they brought, with Danielle worried about Laurie. Maria and Janet assure her that Laurie's fine but Danielle is not assured, saying that their mother always called Laurie "the runt of the litter". After some time of waiting, one of the party goers then screams in shock a cloaked body falls out of a tree near the fire, startling all of the girls. Danielle nervously approaches the body and removes the cloak to see the vampire, bleeding and begging for help. Laurie then appears and assures everyone she's alright, despite the blood oozing from her neck, and that she will also join in their festivities. Maria decides to check up on the vampire and removes his fake fangs. His mask is removed and the "vampire" is revealed to be Principal Wilkins in disguise. The girls at the party, along with Laurie, suddenly transform into werewolves, removing their skin. It is revealed that Laurie's "virginity" actually signifies that she has never killed anyone before and Laurie desired one who she felt, like Wilkins, truly deserved death. Laurie herself begins to change, and leans down to Wilkins to whisper "My, my...what big eyes you have," before lunging into Wilkins' neck. In an act of poetic justice, the serial killer in the guise of a monster has met his own end at the hands/paws to a real beast of the night. The other werewolf girls begin to finish the remains of their own dates, howling at the moon. All the while, the same small boy in the orange footed pajamas and burlap sack looks on from a nearby log.
Kreeg, a Halloween-hating man, lives alone with his dog, Spite, as his only companion. Kreeg shows his disgust for Halloween by scaring away trick-or-treaters and stealing their candy. While at his house, Kreeg proceeds to burn old pictures in his fireplace before settling in his chair to watch TV. Since there is nothing on TV that doesn't have anything to do with Halloween, Kreeg turns it off before seeing an egg hit his window. He runs to the front door and opens it to see that his entire yard is now decorated with dozens of jack-o-lanterns. After finding his bedroom with words scribbled all over the walls and ceiling ("trick r treat, give me something good to eat" being repeated over and over again), he is attacked by Sam (Quinn Lord), the same small boy in the orange footed pajamas who has watched over all of the events of the evening. During the struggle which involved falling down his staircase which is now covered in small pieces of candy and razor blades, Kreeg rips off the sack over Sam's head to reveal his head to be a cross between a jack-o-lantern and a human skull instead of a human child's face underneath. Kreeg runs to his window calling for Mr. Wilkins to help him, but is tackled by Sam. Kreeg gains the upper hand when he manages to fire his shotgun at Sam, seemingly killing him, as well as shooting off one of Sam's hands in the process. As Kreeg dials 9-1-1, the line goes dead and Kreeg is stabbed in the leg again by Sam's severed hand before it crawls back to Sam and reattaches itself to the stump. Sam gets up and puts his mask back on as Kreeg backs up against the wall, knocking a table and its contents to the floor. Sam removes a pumpkin sucker from his pocket and takes a bite out of it, showing the sharp-edged bite marks. He approaches Kreeg, arm raised to stab him and bring the sucker down on Kreegs chest. Instead of stabbing him though, Sam lodges the sucker in the discarded candy bar Kreeg had opened earlier, which had landed on his chest after he knocked the table over. Sam proceeds to chew on the candy bar and takes his leave, now satisfied that a puzzled Kreeg has fulfilled a tradition of Halloween. Meanwhile, pictures burning slowly in a nearby fireplace show a class photo of the masked children from the "School Bus Massacre" and the bus driver, who is revealed to be Kreeg.
Bandaged and bruised from his encounter with Sam, Kreeg answers his door to give candy to trick-or-treaters. While on his porch, he spots Sam walking over to Emma and Henry's house just after she blows out the jack-o'-lantern, revealing himself as Emma's killer in order to punish her for not following Halloween's rules and tradition. Rhonda then walks by along the street, pulling her jack-o'-lantern wagon in an absent-minded manner, and is almost hit by the laughing werewolf girls in their car (in human form) and on their way home from the surprise party. Billy Wilkins is sitting on his porch, handing out candy and wearing a costume to mimic his father's first appearance, complete with glasses and bloody shirt, enjoying himself while unaware that his father is now dead. Kreeg then walks back inside when there is another knock at the door. He opens the door to find the kids from the School Bus Massacre standing there with their bags outstretched, their leader in a vampire costume saying, "Trick 'r Treat", and, suddenly recognizing them, stares in shock. As the credits roll, a series of comic strip panels shows Kreeg being murdered and dismembered by them, the kids having gotten their revenge.

'''''The Revenant''''' is a 2009 dark comedy/horror film written and directed by Kerry Prior and starring David Anders and Chris Wylde. The film was shot in Los Angeles, California.
The film focuses on Second Lieutenant Bart Gregory (David Anders) who has been killed under mysterious circumstances in Iraq. Enlisting the help of his best friend, Joey Leubner (Chris Wylde), Bart begins to understand and learn how to deal with his new undead state; mainly, the fact that Bart needs blood to hold back decomposition and that he returns to a state of in-animation during daylight hours. Joey does research online to find out what Bart is and seems to be stuck between a Zombie and Vampire, finally stating that Bart is a Revenant.
While buying beer from a small store in Koreatown, Bart and Joey become vigilantes when Bart both kills and feeds off of a gangster who is holding up the store. They enjoy the media coverage of the incident, and Joey asks Bart to bestow him with the "dark gift". Bart refuses to do so and laughs the idea off. However, after a subsequent attempt at vigilantism goes wrong and Joey is fatally wounded, Bart is forced to drink Joey's blood in order to save him.
The two continue their vigilante killing spree for a while, until Mathilda (Jacy King), a friend of Janet who dislikes both Bart and Joey, follows them and threatens to reveal their activities to the world, especially Janet. Joey shoots Mathilda through the chest, but before she dies, she is able to send the information to Janet.
Fearing they will be caught, Joey tells Bart to meet him back at the apartment with a packed bag in half an hour, then drives away mysteriously. Bart meets a teary Janet at the apartment, who forces him to explain the fact that he requires blood to stay stable. She then begs him to feed off of her instead, so that he will no longer need to kill. Bart loses control and drains her until she dies.
Joey returns to the apartment with a "pimped out" hearse for the two to use, and suggests that they go to Las Vegas to continue their reign. However, after Bart shows him Janet's corpse, the two begin to fight, and proceed to shoot each other repeatedly, although this is insufficient to kill either of them. Joey storms out and states that he will continue on to Vegas alone. Bart decapitates Janet in order to ensure her death, then drops her remains over the bridge where he and Joey usually disposed of their corpses. Bart is captured by SWAT teams and taken to jail, where, come dawn, he collapses in his cell. Upon nightfall, Bart reawakens in the morgue and escapes, returning to the apartment. Inside is a package containing Joey's severed head.
Since he was decapitated at night, Joey is still "alive", and Bart uses a vibrating dildo to enable Joey's head to talk. Joey warns Bart that a gangbanger who was their first kill is after him for revenge, and then requests that Bart kill him for good. Bart crushes Joey's head underneath a bulldozer, and then tries to find a way to kill himself.
Against normal convention, a bullet through the brain does not have the desired effect, and neither does hanging himself with Christmas lights. He even throws himself in front of the subway train, but only succeeds in severing his arm. Bart then boards a train, where he finds and reads a letter that Janet left in his uniform's pocket at his funeral. He breaks down and attacks the only other passenger. He is caught and flees into the station where more SWAT teams attempt to catch him.
He finally escapes to a hilltop and at dawn collapses once more, while he is being surrounded by men in hazmat suits.
The film then cuts to a tour of sorts, where various military personnel are being shown revenants in glass containers, including Bart. A General asks Bart if he was a soldier, and then states that this fact may give him an advantage.
Bart is then shown in a large canister being airdropped into Khuzestan Province, Iran, along with the other revenants, where the canister opens upon landing, releasing him on the country.

''The Revenant'' was written, directed, and produced by Kerry Prior, who also supervised the visual effects on the film. Liam Finn and Jacques Thelemaque were co-producers. The film was edited by Kerry Prior, though the opening credits state "image juxtaposition designer Walter Montague Urch".
"Walter Montague Urch" could be a reference to Walter Map and Montague Summers, who have written about revenants and men who have returned from the dead.
Filming for ''The Revenant'' began in April 2008 in Los Angeles, California. The film is presented in 4K digital cinema with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 spherical.
''The Revenant'' has received positive feedback from several film reviewers and the horror film community. A post-screening review from DreadCentral.com declared it is "sure to become a cult classic."
The film won the Audience Award for "Best Narrative Feature" at the 2009 CineVegas Film Festival, in Las Vegas. Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote an early review, calling it "a great little genre film that gets exactly as nuts as one would hope a violent buddy flick can get with the undead."
Chris Alexander of ''Fangoria'' stated: "Forget ''Shaun of the Dead''; this is the best dark fantasy/comedy I've seen since classic stuff I hold so dear to my heart, masterworks like ''Return of the Living Dead'', ''Re-Animator'', ''RoboCop'' and ''Fright Night''."
Aaron Morgan from Fantastic Fest commented that "Overall this movie is a real gem and deserves a wide release here in the states to shake us out of this remake/retread horror trend."
Toronto After Dark listed ''The Revenant'' as one of the "10 Movies To See Before You Die".
Since its debut on the film festival circuit, The Revenant has won the following awards:

'''''Messiah of Evil''''' (later also shown under the title '''''Dead People''''') is a 1973 American horror film co-written, co-produced, and co-directed by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, the husband and wife team behind the film version of ''Howard the Duck'' as well as the screenplays for ''American Graffiti'' and ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom''.Bouzereau, Laurent (1997). Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays. New York: Del Rey. ISBN 0-345-40981-7.
A young woman named Arletty (Marianna Hill) drives to the beach town of Point Dune, California, to visit her estranged father, an artist. She finds his house, abandoned. He left a diary in which he addresses her specifically. In it he complains about darkness consuming the town, and horrible nightmares he is having, and implores Arletty to never, ever look for him. His letter tells her to talk to the owner of the art gallery, who sells his paintings. The gallery owner says he has none of her father's paintings, does not sell them, no one ever comes in looking to buy his works, and says he doesn't know where he went. He says Point Dune is "an artist colony" and he only vaguely remembers her father (his paintings are eerie pop art portraits of groups of people in black, white, and gray, standing; the men are always dressed in black suits, white shirts, and black ties, like dead men at a funeral). It is never clear if these are townspeople, or figures from his visions, or both.
Arletty meets a visiting Portuguese-American aristocrat Thom (Michael Greer) and his two extremely provocative, groupie-like female companions, Toni (Joy Bang) and Laura (Anitra Ford). Back at his motel, Thom interviews Charlie, (Elisha Cook, Jr.) the local town eccentric. Charlie speaks at length about "the blood moon" and "the dark stranger" and how he has lived through both. He says very soon it will be the 100 year anniversary of the first appearance of the "dark stranger." He will return, the moon will turn red, and the town will be overrun with evil. Charlie warns Arletty about her father, he says he is "one of them" now. Moments later he is murdered off screen.
Thom, Toni, and Laura are kicked out of their hotel after interviewing Charlie, and stay at Arletty's father's house. Arletty reads through her father's bizarre journal entries, in which he reveals his body temperature is 85 degrees, and he mentions fighting his "condition." Meanwhile, each night, creatures gather on the beach in front of bonfires, staring straight up at the moon. The locals call it "The Waiting."
Late one evening, Laura goes into the local Ralphs supermarket, and is devoured by a hoard of vampires who are feasting on raw meat; the following day, Toni goes to see a movie, and is also eaten by the other theater patrons, who are the same creatures. That evening, the "blood moon" rises, and the town's resident turn into a vampires, and the titular "Messiah of Evil" returns. Through voice-over of Charlie's taped interviews, we learn that this "Messiah" was a former minister and a Donner Party survivor from the late 19th century turned vampire/cannibal, who has come to spread his new "religion" and lead his people up the coast and inland. While Thom hides, two policemen in riot gear drive up and fire their guns into a swarm of vampires; however, one of the cops suddenly begins to bleed, causing his now-former partner to shoot him and flee. Undaunted, the undead cop shoots his former ally, and he and the other vampires go to feast on his flesh.
Thom returns to the house, where he finds Arletty half-crazed; she is cold, cannot feel pain, and thinks she may be dead or undead. She even finds a bug crawling around in her mouth and immediately vomits up various beetles, mealworms and an anole. While Thom was gone, Arletty was visited by her father, who had warned her not to follow him and begs her to leave to tell the world about Point Dune. He then attacks her, reluctantly giving in to his "vampire" urges, and after she stabs him with garden shears before burning him alive. Startled by Thom, she stabs him in the arm with the shears. The two of them flee to the beach, but the ersatz vampires follow them, even in broad daylight. They swim out to the breakers, but Thom drowns. Arletty survives and is captured by the townspeople. Instead of killing her, she is let free under the condition that she spread word of  the religious movement throughout California and the world. This causes her to be locked up in an insane asylum. Each day, all day, she sits in the sun painting, dreading the day the Messiah and his followers come to take her away.

An urban legend regarding the film exists that a key subplot regarding the true nature of Michael Greer|Michael Greer's character "Thom" and his connection to the "Messiah of Evil", aka the "dark stranger" was cut from the final edit of the film.
The film was released on DVD January 1, 2003, and has been fully remastered by Code Red DVD
There are several alternate titles of the film, including: ''Dead People'', ''Return of the Living Dead'', ''Revenge of the Screaming Dead'', and ''The Second Coming''.Dendle (2001), p. 109
The film was involved in a 1970s dispute over its name, when a Chicago distributor released it under the title ''Return of the Living Dead''. The title was chosen to make it sound as part of the ''Living Dead'' franchise and this was misleading. The Laurel Group (also known as Laurel Entertainment), founded in 1976 by George A. Romero and Richard P. Rubinstein, took legal action against this use of the title. Eventually the Motion Picture Association of America decided that Romero did not hold exclusive rights to the terms ''Living Dead'', but ruled against the use of the misleading title for ''Messiah''.Verevis (2010), p. 17
Katz later said the film "was a real bowwow," though Huyck said "it appeared on a marquee in a Woody Allen film, and Film Comment called it 'one of the top 10 classic, overlooked horror films of all time.' " accessed 22 April 2015
Kim Newman considers this film to be a  "neglected" and "surreal" horror film, which has both a convoluted narrative and a peculiar atmosphere. He draws attention to details such as the vanished father being a death-obsessed painter, the daughter falling in with a group of hedonists, the town people turning into ghouls. He also notes that the "dark stranger" was a sinister preacher, whose awaited return comes from the sea. He find all these details to point to the influence of H. P. Lovecraft on the film, while the depiction of the undead derives from their depiction in the ''Living Dead''.Newman (2011), p. 24 Newman points to the "doomed derelict", whose apt warnings are ignored, to be a cliché deriving from gothic fiction.
Ian Cooper comments that the undead of the film seem to be ghoul-like, and zombie-like vampires. He comments that there was a trend in this direction following the release of the ''Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), and ''Messiah'' was one of the films which followed it. He cites among other examples ''Let's Scare Jessica to Death'' (1971), ''The Return of Count Yorga'' (1971), ''Deathdream/Dead of Night'' (1972), and ''Lemora'' (1975).Cooper (2013), p. 25
According to author Glenn Kay, one of the key weaknesses of the film is that "important plot points are never clarified". He notes that the motivations of the lead characters are never properly explained. In particular, Thom is identified as a collector of old legends. But his motivations are even more obscure than those of his female companions.Kay (2008), p. 72-73 Newman points that the strange behavior of the seemingly normal characters adds to the surreal feeling of the film. The titular Messiah of Evil is never properly identified.  Kay finds it problematic that no character reads the father's diary to the end, until it is too late to prevent their fate.
The process of the transformation for the infected is depicted on screen, but said process is also never really explained. The film features a distinctive pattern of symptoms for the infected population of Point Dune. They start bleeding from the eyes, while becoming insensitive to pain. They consume meat and don't seem to be too picky of its source. They all seem to feast on human flesh,  several of them consume the entire meat section of a supermarket, and one of them is seen eating a mouse. Once fully transformed, they reportedly "become mere shells of their former shelves". They all eagerly await the return of the so-called "dark stranger", passing the time by lighting bonfires on the beach and gathering round them. When the long-waited return occurs, they are bound to spread their disease to other areas of California.
The scene of a victim chased through a supermarket and devoured in one of its aisles remains a highlight for the film, though the death is implied and not depicted. It seems to be a depiction of consumerism, in a similar way to the satire of consumerism in ''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978). Newman finds the highlight of the film to be the scene set in the movie theater.  Toni, the "nymphet" as he calls her, is watching a collage of Western scenes. Meanwhile, the decayed theater is increasingly filled up with undead people.Newman (2011), p. 24
Brendan Riley notes that the zombie films of George A. Romero are known for their social criticism, but he believes that the same can be said of non-Romero films of the genre. He notes ''Messiah'' as an example. The undead hordes consist of straight-laced, suit-wearing people. While their targets consist of a Long hair|long-haired dandy and his two lovers.Riley (2011), p. 195
Newman places the film within a specific era of horror film, which he names "the American Nightmare". He defines it as the era starting with ''Night of the Living Dead'' (1968) and ending with ''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978). He defines it as an era where writer-directors started their own film projects, and then went in search of business partners and shady distributors. The films had commercial value, but the creators managed to express their personal concerns within the framework of the genre. He places ''Messiah'' among the one-off oddities produced in this era, and notes that such oddities were regularly released alongside the marketable hits which spawned sequels.Newman (2011), p. 379-382 Newman believes the era properly ended in the early 1980s, when formula-driven franchises such as ''Friday the 13th'' and ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' started dominating the genre.
Matt Serafini of Dread Central identifies the film as an early example of "Nightmare" films, meaning that it portrays many dream-like, psychedelic scenes in an eerie, unsettling atmosphere.

'''''Dead Men Walking''''' is an independent 2005 zombie movie directed by Peter Mervis and written by Mike Watt.  It features a zombie outbreak at a maximum security prison. The film can now be seen on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States.
Travis Dee is slaying many zombies, but blood splashes on Travis' face, infecting him. Travis tries to convince the press and police that they were infected with an experimental bio-toxin, and now he is sick from it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) don't know if he is right or wrong, so he is sentenced to Haywood Maximum Security Prison.
A CDC worker, Samantha Beckett, is sent to the prison to give more information on Travis.
Travis and the new inmates arrive at the facility and are put in a line where they are evaluated by corrections officer, Lieutenant Sweeney, telling them that he is "top of the food chain" in the prison. After noticing Travis coughing heavily and pale, he is sent to the infirmary. Another new arrival, Johnny, is sent to Warden Mahler's office. Mahler tells him not to do anything stupid or make guards angry.
His story is the same that Travis had been telling others. The bitten guard dies and Mahler, Sweeney, Dr. Goring, Samantha and Johnny try to determine if the virus is real. Samantha examines Travis' body and sees that the blood indicates he died at least hours ago, though Sweeney shot him just minutes ago.
Sweeney, Jenkins and Mahler devise a plan to move through the building and gather all the uninfected staff to barricade themselves in the staffroom on the other end of the facility while the guards venture out to kill all infected. He also plans to leave all the uninfected inmates to die, much to Johnny's dismay. Johnny is sent back to the cell but on the way he knocks out a guard and takes his gun to run for the outside.
Sweeney, Jenkins, Mahler and Keith head to the officers' office where Sweeney calls for the National Guard to secure the prison and blockade the entire facility. He stays with his decision to leave the inmates for dead but does tell all of them to stay in their cells. 
Sweeney, Mahler, Keith, Jenkins and many other guards make it to the cell blocks to see that all the inmate and staff left have been infected and zombified. As everyone prepares for the zombies to break out of the cells, Sweeney tells Jenkins that when he turns to shoot him. Mahler, realizing Sweeney is infected, leaves the group to protect his son. The zombies on that side start to follow the two as they slip in zombie blood, trying to reach Mahler's office. The zombies break out of the cell blocks and run for the guards. They open fire, killing many of them left and right. Seeing that many more are coming, they split up and run inside cells and lock the gates, separating them and keeping firing distance. Samantha meets up with Johnny and they decide to escape together.
After most guards are killed in cells, Jenkins and another guard escape the cell while Sweeney and another stay to fight. Sweeney sees the zombified Mahler and shoots him while stating, "This is for not giving me a raise my last evaluation!" After going completely crazy from the disease, Sweeney shoots everywhere, accidentally hitting his partner guard. Sweeney leaves through a backdoor and lies down there while the zombies break through and kill the shot guard.
Samantha and Johnny move on. He is bitten and stays behind to give her a chance to leave. She flees and kills Sweeney, now a zombie. In the yard, Jenkins is bitten and she puts him out of his misery. A sniper mistakes Samantha for a zombie and kills her.
The film was filmed in the Lincoln Heights Jail in Los Angeles, California, USA.
The film has met with mixed reviews.  It currently holds a 3.5/10 rating on The Internet Movie Database.  In his review, Tony Schaab of  called the film "a nice oasis in the desert of straight-to-video zombie flicks" and "worth a look-see for the fan that has seen all the 'popular' undead films and is looking for something else to satisfy their appetite for destruction."

'''''Hell of the Living Dead''''' () is a 1980 Italian-Spanish horror film directed by Bruno Mattei The film is set in a laboratory in Papua New Guinea that sends out a dangerous chemical that turns the technicians and locals into zombies. An Italian news reporter (Margit Evelyn Newton) and her crew land on the island to investigate.
''Hell of the Living Dead'' was a project developed by producers and given to director Bruno Mattei who attempted to create film similar to ''Dawn of the Dead'' but lighter in tone. It was shot in five weeks in Spain with a script that was not Mattei's first choice and a score by the band Goblin which was taken from other film scores they had performed.
The film has generally received negative reviews noting bad dialogue and being derivative of the 1978 film ''Dawn of the Dead''. 
At a top secret chemical research facility called Hope Center #1, a rat causes a chemical leak and dies; but as two workers investigate, that rat suddenly comes back to life and kills one of the men. Subsequently, the entire staff of the plant turn into flesh-eating zombies. A four-man team of commandos led by Lt. Mike London (José Gras) are deployed to eliminate a group of Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists who have taken hostages inside a large building at the US Embassy in Barcelona, Spain. The terrorists demand the closing down of all the Hope Centers, which both the government and the military deny exist; the press, under orders of the local authorities, do not publicize the terrorists' demands or mention the disaster at the Hope Center. After pumping tear gas into the building, Lt. London and his three commandos burst into the room where the terrorists are and kill them all. Once the mission is completed, the team loses contact with Hope Center #1. Thinking that the complex has been infiltrated by terrorists, the team flies to Papua New Guinea. There they meet journalist Lia Rousseau (Margit Evelyn Newton) and her cameraman, who are investigating a series of mysterious, violent attacks on the locals.
Hordes of flesh-eating zombies attack the native village. The four military men and two journalists travel through the New Guinea jungle in the commando's jeep, trying to survive while evading the zombies. The group takes refuge at an abandoned plantation, only to come under attack from the zombie residents. The flesh-eating residents kill and eat one of the commandos, forcing the surviving group to flee. Rousseau and London's men battle their way to a beach where they take a raft, and finally arrive at Hope Center #1. All of the workers are either dead or roaming the facility as zombies. Rousseau and London learn about the experimental chemical that was accidentally released, which kills people and turns them into zombies. From audiotaped notes and papers left behind in the offices, Rousseau learns that the chemical, coded as "Operation Sweet Death", had been intended to curb the Third World population by driving it to prey on each other. In the end, however, neither London's team nor the two journalists make it out alive; the zombies attack from all directions, and they are all killed or made members of the walking dead.
Some time later, the zombie contagion has spread beyond the borders of the country and throughout the world. While politicians and scientists dispute the matter, a young couple in the developed world are attacked and devoured by a horde of zombies in a city park.
Director Bruno Mattei noted that the production began as a specific request from the producer. Mattei's plan was to make a film inspired by the 1978 film ''Dawn of the Dead'' but that he wanted a lighter tone for the film. Mattei said that initially two screenplays were written for the film, and that the producers rejected the screeplay that Mattei preferred. The film was Mattei's first to be made under the name Vincent Dawn, a request made specifically by the Spanish production side of the film. Among the cast was Margit Evelyn Newton as Lia.
''Hell of the Living Dead'' was shot in 5 weeks. The film includes stock footage to suggest that the film was set in New Guinea. The production had this footage from the beginning of shooting the film and had rebuilt some of the locations from the stock footage in Spain where the film was shot.
Parts of the film were improvised on set, such as when a character enters a room imitating Gene Kelly in his film ''Singing in the Rain''. The film score is credited to the band Goblin, but is mostly taken from other film scores Goblin performed, such as ''Dawn of the Dead'' and ''Contamination''. Mattei was a fan of their music and through Carlo Bizio got their music available for his film.
The film was first distributed in 1980. The film has been released under several titles, including ''Night of the Zombies'' and ''Zombie Creeping Flesh''.
From a contemporary review, Steve Jenkins (''Monthly Film Bulletin'') noted that the possibility of a subversive sub-text involving Third World victims corrupted by scientific research was "truly buried here in an orgy of flesh chewing and vomiting, as well as dialogue that beggars belief." The review commented positively that the film had unexpected pleasures, such as "the ludicrous attempts to dub speech on to stock footage (featuring humans) and a story, low-budget UN meeting consisting of a handful of delegates hurling pieces of paper at each other." 
From retrospective reviews, Glenn Kay (''Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide'') also noted the poor dialogue, as well as bad shot composition with scenes changing from day to night between cuts, slow pacing and the cast overacting.
Mattei would later express that he felt the dialogue in the film was "pretty stupid" and that like all his films, he would reshoot it if possible. When asked how she felt about the film in 2013, actress Margit Evelyn Newton responded that "Obviously seeing it now, I would change some things. But that is okay. Virus has helped me get more work."

'''''Les Raisins de La Mort''''' (English title: ''The Grapes of Death'') is a 1978 French horror film directed by Jean Rollin. It centres on a young woman who becomes trapped in a village where a dangerous pesticide has turned the residents into aggressive zombies.
When a worker at the Roublès winemaking vineyard becomes ill, complaining of a pain in his neck, his boss insists it's a minor injury and tells him to go back to work.
Élizabeth is travelling by train to Roublès to live with her fiancé, the owner of the vineyard.  She makes a friend with a woman on the train.  The worker with the neck pain boards the train and stares at Élizabeth's friend.  Élizabeth becomes worried when her new friend excuses herself to visit the restroom and doesn't return for a long time; the man then comes and sits with her. The man's neck starts to bleed.  Élizabeth escapes him and discovers her friend dead on the restroom floor.
Leaving the train, Élizabeth flees to a nearby village for help.  A man and his daughter are sitting quietly inside a house. Élizabeth describes to them what happened, and they tell her to rest and recover from her shock.  Panicking, she enters the bedroom and discovers a woman whose throat has been cut.  The man's daughter calmly explains that the dead woman is her mother, and that her father killed her because he's become insane.  The woman and Élizabeth leave the house, but her father catches them and rips open his daughter's blouse to reveal several wounds.  He has the same wounds; so did the man on the train.  He tells his daughter she will not suffer the way he did and sticks a garden fork into her chest.  Élizabeth flees and takes the man's car.  When he gets in front of it and begs her to kill him, she runs him over and drives off.
Élizabeth travels further into the village to look for help and is approached by a man whose head is covered with the infection.  He smashes his head against the car window until it breaks and Élizabeth shoots him.  She comes across a blind girl named Lucy who is searching for her caregiver, Lucas.  Élizabeth helps her and discovers a lot of dead bodies covered with the infection.  Lucy knows something is wrong but Élizabeth won't tell her so she runs of in search of Lucas.  She eventually finds him, unaware he is infected and insane and he strangles her.  Élizabeth hears her screams and finds her dead and tied up to a door, where Lucas chops off her head.  As the zombies chase her, a woman rescues her. This woman has been trapped in a house for a few days, so she and Élizabeth try to get out and run, but the woman grabs Élizabeth and gives her to Lucas.  Two men, Paul and Lucien show up and start to kill the zombies.  The woman goes to them for help, so they tell her to wait by their truck.  Élizabeth fights Lucas off and goes to the truck where she and the woman get into a fight, resulting in the woman getting her face burned.  She then blows up the truck.
Élizabeth, Paul and Lucien walk to Roublès and on the way they discover that it was a wine festival on the Sunday before that caused the villagers to turn into zombies.  Once they arrive at Roublès, Paul and Lucien have something to eat while Élizabeth searches for her fiancé.  She finds him and discovers he is infected.  Paul shoots him so Èlizabeth shoots Paul and then she shoots Lucien.

'''''Dead Air''''' is a 2009 American science fiction-horror film directed by Corbin Bernsen and starring Bill Moseley and Patricia Tallman. The story focuses on a radio station that warns its listeners after an explosion unleashes zombies into Los Angeles. Screenwriter Kenny Yakkel explained before the film's release that the "undead" presented are not actual zombies: "It's like a PCP zombie movie, that's my take on it 'cause they're not really dead."
A plague in the form of a toxic viral gas is unleashed at major sporting events across the United States. The gas turns its victims instantly "into an immediate rage of insanity and violence". Controversial Los Angeles talk show radio host Logan Burnhardt and his production team are caught up in the middle of the chaos. Only blocks away from the explosion site, they begin to receive reports of rioters in the streets and listeners continue to call in reports of their first hand experiences. In addition to those infected by the virus, the terrorists, led by Abir, responsible for the attacks attempt to make their way to Logan's studio and kill anyone in the way.

''Dead Air'' began filming in March, 2007 on location in Los Angeles and production wrapped on the film in late April 2007.
Though originally slated for a Winter 2007 theatrical release, ''Dead Air'', was released on October 27, 2009, on DVD.
Paul Mount of ''Starburst'' rated it 6/10 stars and called it "an enjoyably hokey experience" that overcomes its derivativeness.  Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic Peter Dendle said that although the film is often compared to ''Pontypool'', it stands on its own and has a different message: political and social versus the more philosophical and linguistic themes of ''Pontypool''.

Despite the carnage of ''Dead Space'', four survivors are found: Nicholas Kuttner, a security officer; Alejandro Borgas, an engineer; Nolan Stross, chief science officer; and Isabella Cho, chief medical officer. The survivors are imprisoned in a holding cell while the ship is en route to the Sprawl, a station built on a shard of Titan. The head interrogator is told by the Overseer he has seven hours to get information from the survivors.
Kuttner is interrogated first and gives his account of the events: he, Cho, Borgas, and Stross are assigned by the O'Bannon's commanding officer to stabilize the gravity on Aegis VII. Assisting are soldiers Rin and Sergenko, along with two additional engineers, Borgas' cousins Noah and Omar, a Unitologist. Campbell secretly tasks Kuttner's crew to bring back pieces of the Marker, which are worth millions of credits per kilo. The group land on Aegis VII, which is now unstable. While the engineers work the gravity stabilizer, Kuttner's crew split up. Kuttner finds a Marker shard, which causes a horrifying hallucination, making him murderously unstable. He damages the stabilizer before his teammates can tie him up in the shuttle. After finishing his interrogation Kuttner is able to escape and follows a phantom of Vivian out of an airlock, killing several marines,
Borgas is next to be interrogated and gives his account: the attempted gravity stabilization fails and the group is forced to make a hasty escape. Rin, Sergenko and Omar were killed but the rest managed to make it aboard the shuttle and escape the planet just in time. Borgas is forced to crash land the shuttle onto the ''O'Bannon''. Aegis VII explodes seconds before the ship can jump out of the system. The debris causes severe damage to the ShockPoint Drive. Borgas, enraged by his cousin's death, demands to know the importance of the shard. When the captain explains the shard's monetary value, Borgas assaults him. After Cho calms him down, he follows the captain's order to fix the drive. The interrogators determine Borgas did not come in contact with the shard and due to him knowing too much he is executed by the Marines. Stross is brought in next.
Stross' duties as chief science officer are putting a strain on his relationship with his wife Alexis and infant son, causing Alexis to suspect Nolan and Isabel are having an affair; this is true. After escaping Aegis VII Stross begins to closely study the shard that Kuttner had collected. He unfortunately falls victim to the shard, causing him to obsess over it; to this end, he learns it can create Necromorphs, believing to have been designed by a higher power. Unfortunately, when he proves this, it causes at outbreak. Stross attempts to return to his quarters to protect his family but hallucinates that they are necromorphs and brutally murders them. The interrogators determine Stross to be of value and keep him for further study.
Finally, Cho is interrogated and reveals the finale of the events: just after the outbreak she and several other doctors arrived at the morgue. They find the bodies gone and several doctors killed. One of the bodies turns into a Necromorph, causing the group to flee. She releases Kuttner, who kills the Necromorph. They eventually meet up with Captain Campbell, who is fighting the Necromorphs with the security team including First Officer Leslie Pallas. As the group flees into the vents Leslie is caught by a Necromorph and killed. They make it to Stross' lab, where they meet with Borgas, and two officers from the bridge, Lieutenant Marcus and Lana. Stross explains that destroying the shard could stop the Necromorphs. Borgas says that throwing it into the portal drive could not only destroy it, but restart the drive. With weapons made by Borgas, they head to engineering. Lana is surprised to see that her roommate Jenny is still alive, however when she gets close enough against Isabel's warnings she sees she is a Necromorph. The Necromorph spits acid into Lana's face melting all the skin off her face. Lana begins screaming having survived the attack when she and the Necromorph are killed in a grenade blast. Debris from the planet causes a hull breach, damaging the outer door control for engineering. Lieutenant Marcus is almost saved by Kuttner but a Necromorph grabs him causing him to lose his grip and be blown out into space. Captain Campbell sacrifices himself to seal the door manually. The four survivors battle the Necromorphs to get to the portal drive. When Stross refuses to throw the shard into the drive, Cho does it. The drive's energy destroys the shard. The feedback from the destroyed shard causes all the Necromorphs to liquefy.
After giving her account, Cho is informed that the ''Abraxis'' has reached the Sprawl. Cho surmises that her superiors are aware of the effects of the Marker and are using those exposed as human guinea pigs. The Overseer accompanies Cho to the Sprawl and has the interrogator and his assistant killed. The Overseer offers Cho a position as head of the project, but Cho refuses after seeing what her superiors have done. She is lobotomised.
The Overseer and his assistant watch a news report where Cho is accused of being a terrorist responsible for the ''Ishimura'', Aegis VII colony, and ''O'Bannon'' disasters. They then discuss studying Stross, highlighting their luck in finding two people who have come into contact with the Marker. They proceed to store him in the lab where, in the slot next to him, is the other person - the crazed engineer that they found floating in a shuttle weeks ago who was responsible for destroying Aegis VII. The name of the engineer, Isaac Clarke, is then seen on a holographic monitor, marking the beginning of ''Dead Space 2''.

'''''Dead Space: Downfall''''' is an American animated horror film developed by Film Roman and Electronic Arts. It is a prequel to the video game ''Dead Space'' and takes place during the events of ''Dead Space: Extraction'', while the Necromorphs invade the USG ''Ishimura'' after it receives the Marker. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 28, 2008 and broadcast on the Syfy Channel on December 2, 2008.
An alien artifact, identified as a possible "second Marker", is discovered on the planet Aegis VII. The Church of Unitology uses its influence to send the mining ship USG ''Ishimura'' to retrieve this holy relic.
While the ship approaches, they receive radio reports of an outbreak of violent behavior among the colonists. The Marker is brought aboard by order of Captain Benjamin Mathius (Jim Cummings). Head of Security Alissa Vincent (Nika Futterman) asks to investigate the colony, but Mathius believes nothing is amiss. While the ''Ishimura'' extracts a chunk of the planet to mine, a man in the ship's sick bay, Hans Leggio, (Jeff Bennett) struggles against his restraints and resists sedation, begging to be killed.
Meanwhile, two miners on Aegis VII check an outpost that has gone silent. One man, Farum (Cummings) vanishes during a blackout, while the other, Colin Barrow (Bruce Boxleitner) sees his wife Jen (Lia Sargent) commit suicide. Barrow takes her body and flees the facility in a shuttle, unaware of an alien presence attached to the corpse.
The ''Ishimura'' re-establishes links with the colony, receiving evidence of a massacre. The captain refuses to radio for help, as he would face a court martial for entering a restricted system. He orders that the planet be quarantined and return to Earth with the Marker. Barrow's shuttle crashes into the ''Ishimura's'' hangar, just as he is killed by his mutated wife. Vincent and her security teammates Ramirez (Hal Sparks), Hanson (Phil Morris), Dobbs (Bennett), Pendleton (Kevin Michael Richardson), and Shen (Kelly Hu) are dispatched to arrest and quarantine the people on the shuttle, but they find nothing aboard but pools of blood. Leggio awakens to discover alien creatures mutating the corpses in the morgue, which then kill him. The security team follows trails of blood towards the morgue, where Dobbs is killed by an infected Leggio. Tensions flare as Unitologist crew members demand to see the Marker; they are quickly calmed and dispersed by engineer Samuel Irons (Richardson), a Unitologist.
The security team fight the infestation as it spreads through the ship, with Irons joining them after saving them from the Necromorphs in the ship's mess hall where Pendleton is swarmed and killed. Dr. Terrence Kyne (Keith Szarabajka) tells Mathius that the Marker is responsible for the colonists going insane, killing each other and causing the infestation and must not be taken to Earth, fearing that the Necromorphs will wipe out every last human on Earth, but the captain claims religious persecution and mutiny. As tension rises on the Bridge, captain Mathius is accidentally killed by Kyne in an attempt to sedate him, who flees the bridge. The escape pods are launched empty and the communications systems destroyed.
On the way to the bridge, Hanson goes insane and kills Shen, then is in turn killed by Ramirez. Vincent, Irons, and Ramirez return to the bridge where they learn that the ship is almost entirely overrun; they then discover that Kyne is sabotaging the ship's engines, to scuttle the ship on the planet to stop the Necromorphs from spreading.
On their way to confront Kyne, the team finds survivors trapped by Necromorphs. Irons buys time for Vincent and Ramirez to extract the scared crew members by using himself as bait, and is killed. Ramirez sacrifices himself getting Vincent into the control room. She confronts Kyne, who claims that his actions are necessary to stop the alien outbreak from leaving the system. Vincent fails to restore the engines, and Kyne escapes with her weapon.
Vincent finds herself surrounded by Necromorphs and run for the Marker, but learns that the creatures cannot come into close proximity with the artifact, which kept them imprisoned on Aegis VII. Spurred on by a vision of Ramirez, Vincent leaves a video log that details the entire sequence of events, adding that the Marker and the ''Ishimura'' must be destroyed. She uploads the video log to a distress beacon, opens the airlock and launches the beacon from the downed shuttle. Vincent and the Necromorphs are blown out into space.
Vincent's body drifts in space as the song "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" plays. The story ends as the USG ''Kellion'' arrives and prepares to dock on the ''Ishimura'' - the beginning of ''Dead Space''.

'''''Wicked Little Things''''' (also known as '''''Zombies''''') is a 2006 zombie horror film directed by J. S. Cardone and stars Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and Chloë Grace Moretz. It also claims to be based on true events.
In 1913, in Carlton, Pennsylvania (shot in Bulgaria), the cruel owner of the Carlton mine exploits poor immigrant children. In order to excavate a new shaft quickly, he employs a dynamite charge, but the explosion causes the mine to collapse, burying a large group of the children alive. Following his later trial for wilfully causing the death of his workers, Carlton is acquitted and the mine closed down.
In present day, eighty years later, Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease and has inherited his birthhome near the since-abandoned Carlton mine. She moves to the house with her daughters, Sarah and Emma. The three stop by the local market for supplies and are told by Walter, the shopkeeper, that he doesn't deliver to the area they live in. While driving, Karen has a near miss with a man crossing the road. She exits the car, looking for the man, but he's nowhere to be found. They arrive at the house and Sarah points out the blood on the door while Karen declares it's just "paint."
When Emma hears children giggling, she leaves the house, following the sound of it. Karen goes out looking for Emma and finds her in an old mine. As they try to find their way back to the house, it becomes nightfall and they get lost. They find a house, which is occupied by Hanks, and enter. Karen is advised by Hanks to stay at home during the night, and he also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny's door.
William Carlton, the last surviving heir of the Carlton estate, which has owned the mine since 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property. Meanwhile, the zombie children begin to kill, which is dismissed among the community as disappearances, though it is hinted that most of the community is aware of the presence of the children.
As it turns out, the Tunny and Hanks families are relatives of the zombie children who happen to leave blood relatives alive while killing all others. Emma, who has had friendly contact with a less-violent zombie named Mary, informs her mother that the zombies won't eat her, and that Mary would not directly hurt her mother (who is not a direct Tunny blood relative), but passes on the warning that the other children might. Karen finds some old family photo albums in the basement that contain pictures of her late husband, as well as the Tunny and Hanks children who died in the mine disaster, thus revealing that the family is related to some of the children who had died.
Karen and Sarah leave the house to go look for Emma. As they exit the mine, not being able to find Emma, they become surrounded by a dozen of the children. They escape, with the children pursuing them, and find a car passing through with Carlton inside. They enter, telling him to drive, but the tires are slashed before they can pull away. 
Karen and Sarah run to Hanks' house, unsure of what to do. Soon enough, Karen figures out that Hanks' blood has a supposed repellent effect on the zombie children. As both Hanks and Carlton attempt to shoot the children, they realize the bullets are ineffective, and run to the barn. 
Hanks realizes that, as he and Emma are direct blood relatives, it turns out Mary has an older brother that's also a Tunny, and Karen is in some way protected by Emma's relationship with Mary. The children are really after Carlton, as they blame his family for the mining accident that killed them. 
After Carlton is killed by the children, Emma remarks that they won't be hurting anyone anymore. 
At the end, the Tunny family drives away and reveals that the house has not been sold. Now, Mary lives in the house, with the bear that Emma gave her, with a few of the other children as well

'''''Automaton Transfusion''''' is an independent horror film written and directed by Steven C. Miller. 
''Automaton Transfusion'' was shot on location in Orlando, Florida on an estimated budget of $30,000. It is intended to be the first of a trilogy of horror films and emulates classic examples of the genre.  The film was purchased and released by Dimension Extreme, the straight-to-DVD genre arm of The Weinstein Company.
In the early 1970s, when everyone in America was worrying about what was going on in Vietnam, the United States Army was secretly developing a way to resurrect and control the dead. Their intention was to have the dead fight instead of the living, but the experiments were shut down when the reanimated corpses were unable to control their hunger for human flesh. 
Thirty years later the army decides to reopen the project. Grover City, because of its remote location, would be the home of their main testing facilities. Without warning, the Grover City experiments go horribly wrong and the reanimated corpses go on a rampage, eating everyone in sight. 
With the town overtaken by zombies, a group of High School seniors take it upon themselves to fight back and find a cure for the disease.
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 50% of six surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.3/10.

'''''World of the Dead: The Zombie Diaries 2''''' is a 2011 British horror film written by Kevin Gates. The film is a sequel to ''The Zombie Diaries''.
The film received a limited cinema release in the UK followed by a DVD released on 27 June. The film was released in US cinemas on 2 September 2011. The leads are played by Alix Wilton Regan, Philip Brodie and Vicky Aracio.
A family is holding a birthday for their daughter during the apocalypse, maintaining the illusion things are still normal despite their only light source being a camcorder and birthday candles. It is clear, however, that they have barely been surviving as zombies overwhelm them.
The footage of the "birthday" is archived by a military photographer, Jones, who documents his team's efforts of surviving the zombie onslaught in a remote beachside compound. There, they take in survivors, both infected and not, including the sole survivor of the last movies original film crew, Leanne (now portrayed by Alix Wilton Regan). Together, along with a medical officer, the team attempts to hold out as long as possible. Things take a turn for the worse, as zombies break in and overrun the facility. Only Leanne, Jones, and a handful of soldiers make it out alive, forced to leave behind one of their own.
The survivors find their way to a remote cabin where they attempt to hold up for the night as it begins snowing. However, the zombie population has grown too much for anywhere to be safe and they are once more forced to flee. With their transportation incapacitated, they make a dangerous trek through the brutal outdoors at night.
The next day, the survivors continue to seek any kind of sanctuary. While walking in the woods, they discover booby-traps and the macabre remains of dispatched zombies. Figuring it to be human bandits, they carefully avoid numerous traps, until they come across the enemy hideout. It is here they discover the true enemies of the living, a bastion of psychopathic renegades led by the notorious Goke (Russell Jones). Hardened by the elements, Goke is once again aided by his sidekick Manny and several other humans, that he leads with no discrimination.
Two of the soldiers, Jones and Carter, secretly witness Goke's men sexually assault an infected female, until the leader steps out and shoots her in the head before chastising them. Jones and Carter return to the others to inform them of the situation before falling back into the woods. Leanne, at this point, had yet to see her past tormentors, however she recognises the grim location she had been found prior to the movies opening.
Throughout the day, the soldiers and Leanne use hand to hand tactics against the undead to keep the bandits from knowing their location. They continue this until night as they camp, each survivor divulging their personal lives as it is now clear that there is indeed hope... a ship preparing to leave. Their discussion is cut short as they hear the sounds of someone nearby, discovering that the bandits are in fact searching for them. Tragedy strikes as Leanne is discovered and reunited with Goke and Manny. Uninterested in raping her again, Goke promises that she will have a special fate. The soldiers, in hiding, strike against the gang and rescue Leanne. In the shootout, zombies overwhelm both sides as Carter is unfortunately shot and subsequently devoured.
As Leanne and the soldiers are once again forced into the night, they find themselves in a cemetery while the bandits dispatch the living dead. As another dawn once again gives the survivors light, they are unfortunately captured after a devastating shootout leaving the last female soldiers, Kayne (Vicky Araico), injured. Fate is once again cruel to Leanne, as she and her fellow captives are once again in the same barn the military rescued her from.
Goke, Manny and his crew subdue and tie up the survivors, keeping Kayne separated as well as taking control of Jones' camera. Goke sets his evil sights on torturing them, having a mentally impaired follower named Billy beat the team's leader. Leanne even goes as far as to call Goke by his name, begging him to stop. He does not, allowing Billy to violently assault the leader.
Goke and Billy enter the next room to find Manny torturing the injured Kayne. they then prepare Billy for "initiation", by raping her. Hesitant throughout, Billy is physically forced to sexually assault and stab the woman to death. Before Goke can rape her dead body, gunshots are heard in the next room. The three reenter the holding room of the barn to find that all the survivors are still tied up and one of his men shot dead, a victim of Nicholson, the soldier left behind in the beginning of the movie who had been following behind his comrades all along. Another psycho, Curtis, has his throat slit and Manny is shot. Goke manages to flee outside and after a short shootout, escapes.
Having been freed by Nicholson, Leanne oversees an injured Manny who taunts her before meeting a bloody end at the young woman's shotgun.
After the burial and mourning for Kayne, the soldiers leader, Maddox, is interrogated by the others who discover the truth of the UK's fate. A large scale firebombing has been ordered for the next morning. With his hopes set on the boats, Maddox leads Jones, Leanne and Nicholson to a nearby bunker where the last known military holdout was known to be. The soldiers of the bunker are all dead, leaving the survivors in a state of panic. Maddox, close to losing all hope, runs out to find where the soldiers had left markers for the boats which never came. Insistent on waiting, despite the sounds of the jets overhead, he remains behind as the others engage in combat against an army of zombies.
While Jonesy, Nicholson and Leeann are still in the bunker, zombies come in surrounding them. Nicholson orders them to fight but Jonesy is too scared and can only watch. Nicholson is killed and Jonesy instead watches Leeann fight them herself but she tires out and falls and is killed as well. Jonesy then states his failure to the camera and commits suicide via pistol when a zombie grabs him.
Footage throughout the film, show soldiers in hazmat gear gathering survivors and killing them to prevent further infection reveal them to be Jones, Maddox, Carter and Kayne, facing the psychological damage of slaughtering possible innocents and burning their remains during a time when the infection wasn't clear. For the last time, a camera blinks out.

'''''Phantoms''''' is a 1998 American science fiction horror film adapted from Dean Koontz's 1983 novel of the same name. Directed by Joe Chappelle with a screenplay by Koontz, the film stars Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan, Joanna Going, Liev Schreiber, Ben Affleck, Nicky Katt, and Clifton Powell. The film takes place in the peaceful town of Snowfield, Colorado, where something evil has wiped out the community. It is up to a group of people to stop it or at least get out of Snowfield alive.
Dr. Jennifer Pailey brings her sister Lisa to the resort town of Snowfield, Colorado, a small ski resort village nestled in the Rocky Mountains where Jenny works as a doctor. Once in town, the sisters find no one around but a few corpses. At first, their suspicions are that of a serial killer loose in town. After finding the severed heads of the town baker and his wife in an oven, the sisters are found by Sheriff Bryce Hammond, a former FBI agent haunted by the death of a boy he accidentally killed, and his deputies Stu Wargle and Steve Shanning who came to investigate the strange killings.
When they arrive at a nearby hotel, the group finds the writing of a victim on the mirror reading Timothy Flyte. Moments later, Shanning investigates a sound outside with the others finding only his gun, hat and shoes while the rest of him is gone. Returning to the sheriff's office to request aid and create roadblocks around Snowfield, with Wargle revealed to be paranoid and immoral, the group gets a strange call before they are attacked by a strange moth-like creature that rips Wargle's face off prior to Bryce killing it. After implying the creature could be the Devil as it went after him first, Lisa later encounters Wargle while in the bathroom before she and others find his body missing from the morgue.
At that time, Bryce's FBI associates find Flyte, a British academic who theorized the Ancient Enemy, an entity he generalizes as "chaos in the flesh" that periodically wiped out civilizations including that of the Mayas and the Roanoke Island colonists. Joined by an Army commando unit to Snowfield with the Pailey sisters and Bryce meeting with him, Flyte accompanies a third of the commando group to investigate with him the only survivor of an attack by a creature in the form of a dog that converted the others in his group.
With the other unit members systematically wiped out by it, the last member giving them a sample he vomited before turning into a puddle of black liquid, Flyte and the group learn the nature of the Ancient Enemy as it sent its converted drones, the Phantoms, to kill off the National Guard stations around the town.
Revealed to actually be an Earth-based amoebic life form that mimics its absorbed victims while gaining their knowledge, the Enemy creates Phantoms as temporary detachments for it to act through before absorbing them back into it. Furthermore, due to its victims' thoughts about it, the Enemy has ultimately perceived itself as a god and had arranged everything so Flyte can assist the creature in revealing its existence to the world. Flyte also learns that the creature's body is physiologically almost identical to crude oil, and could be killed by bacteria bio-engineered to ingest fossil fuels.
However, other than the limited amount they have, the issue remains to get the bacteria into the nucleus that is within the main body of the Enemy. But because the Ancient Enemy is extremely proud, the group has Flyte call it all in its entirety as he played on its god complex by revealing their plan up front. After its nucleus absorbs all the Phantoms while emerging from the sewers to assume a Mother Mass form, Bryce and the Pailey sisters fire the bacteria into the Ancient Enemy before it retreats underground with Bryce in pursuit.
While the Pailey sisters find themselves dealing with the Phantom in Wargle's image before Jenny seemingly kills it with a gun containing the bacteria, Bryce finds the Ancient Enemy as it assumed the form of the boy he accidentally killed during an FBI drug raid. When the boy grabbed the last vial he had, Bryce shoots at it to expose the creature to its contents as it dies from the bacteria.
Though Bryce reassures Lisa and Jenny that it is gone, with the former stating the townsfolk are at peace, Flyte admits the Ancient Enemy did achieve its victory as he decides to tell the world what happened with a book based on what occurred in Snowfield. Some time later, watching Flyte being interviewed about his book, ''The Ancient Enemy'', two bar patrons argue about the existence of alien life. Hearing laughter nearby, the patrons turn to see Wargle as he asks them if they want to see something interesting.

The film was not released until six years after it was made. Film distributor Jerry Gross bought it and paired it on a double bill with ''I Drink Your Blood'' and renamed it ''I Eat Your Skin'', although the two have nothing in common. Previous titles of the film include ''Zombie Bloodbath'' and ''Voodoo Blood Bath''.
In a review of a box set, David Cornelius of DVD Talk wrote, "The film was produced in 1964 but went undistributed for six long years, and one look explains why: it's an utterly square attempt at early-60s hipness".  In ''The Zombie Moving Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle wrote, "Nevermind the title-this is as mild as horror gets, and nobody eats any skin."

 is a 2010 Japanese splatter film directed by  Yoshihiro Nishimura. It stars Yumiko Hara and Eihi Shiina, and was written by Nishimura and Daichi Nagisa.
A schoolgirl named Kika and her father are living in a condemned set of houses where they are ultimately found by her mother, Rikka, and her uncle, Yasushi, both serial killers who murder and cannibalize their victims. Once the father is burned to death, Kika attempts to escape, but is caught by the homicidal siblings. Seconds later, a meteorite seen falling from space crashes into Rikka's back, leaving a large-sized hole in her body where her heart once was, forcing her to rip out Kika's as a replacement. After the two are then left in a cocoon-like state, a large blast of black toxic ash makes it way from Rikka and begins to cover the northern half of Japan. Thirty-six hours later, the ash had dissipated, but those who have inhaled it have been turned into bloodthirsty zombies. Days later, the country is then divided into two by a large wall, keeping the zombies north while most of Japan's uninfected population remain south.
One year later, Kika's cocooned body had been found by an unknown organization and given an artificial heart unit to keep her alive. Once dropped at the wall, she is forced to defend herself against several zombies with a katana-shaped chainsaw, finding out that the best way to kill them is by severing the antler-like horn that grows out of their foreheads. At the same time, she manages to rescue a man named Taku and his mute companion, No-Name, both who collect horns off the zombies they kill to sell off to potential buyers as the horns contains an unknown substance that could be turned into an illicit drug. After having a nightmare, Kika experiences a great amount of pain from her heart inside Rikka's body, which has been freed from its cocoon-like state as well, still alive and Rikka claiming herself as a "queen" of the zombies. Sometime later, she, Taku, and No-name are arrested along with a gang they were trying to sell horns to as the contents of them produced unstable and volatile effects, making them illegal.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hatoda and his supporters are strongly defending the zombies, beveling them to be still human. However, this is met by criticism by Justice Minister Osawa and those who agree with him, declaring them to be nothing more than monsters who must be wiped out before they could overrun Japan. Once learning that Osawa was the one that saved Kika to be used as an experiment in the killing of the zombies, Hatoda decides to further strengthen his cause. At a speech near the wall where the prime minister is set to give a speech, Osawa plants a bomb on it which blows a hole open, causing several zombies to come through and attack. Before Hatoda is ripped apart by them, he screams out that the zombies are indeed no longer human. With his death, Osawa declares himself as the new prime minister.
Kika and her companions are freed from custody after agreeing to track down and capture or kill Rikka, whom the government has managed to identify as the source of the zombie outbreak and are given supplies to work with. Hours after entering the northern half of the country, the group is attacked by decapitated zombie heads used as crude bombs, but are saved by an ex-cop named Kaito. Shortly after, they enlist his help to find No-Name's sister, Maya, who had gone missing during the outbreak. The group manages to find her at a zombified bar where she is being fed on by Yasushi himself and barely saves her during a series of attacks. While escaping, the group is chased by Yasushi and the zombified bar's owner in a car fashioned out of zombie body parts. During the chase, Kika kills the owner while Taku sacrifices himself to drive both him and Yasushi in the latter's vehicle over a cliff. Having lost a lot of blood from her torture, Maya ultimately dies as a result, leaving No-Name greatly saddened.
Kika, Kaito, and No-Name eventually reach Rikka, who greets them using a giant body made out of zombies. While Rikka tortures Kika by abusing the latter's heart, No-Name fires a tracking signal onto Rikka's location, alerting Osawa to fire a series of missiles at her, two of which are captured by Rikka and used to make the giant body airborne to head in the direction of southern Japan. Kika manages to get onto the giant body before it leaves to fight Rikka, but is intercepted by Yasushi who had survived Taku's attack and fights her. While Yasushi is briefly distracted, she kicks him into one of the missiles which explodes, killing him. At the same time, thousands of zombies on the ground have broken through the wall, attacking the southern half of the country. After being attacked by a zombie himself, Osawa is killed by his own guards once they had mistaken him to be one as well.
With the makeshift zombie plane unstable and now traveling back towards northern Japan, Kika engages Rikka in a fistfight. Having gained the upper hand, Kika takes back her heart and kills Rikka by decapitating her, causing all of the zombies in Japan to fall to the ground dead and the plane to start falling apart. Nearly falling to her death, Kika is quickly saved by No-Name and Kaito. No longing needing any use for her original heart, she crushes it in her hand.
During the end credits, the final missile explodes, launching Rikka's severed head into space where it eventually lands on an alien planet and  presumably striking an inhabitant the same way the meteorite did to Rikka.

Director Yoshihiro Nishimura began working on the script to ''Helldriver'' in 2009. Nishimura took influence from George A. Romero's film ''Night of the Living Dead'' which dealt with current events of the day. Nishimura stated that there was "quite a lot of satire and social criticism in this film...I describe what ensues after the nation splits in two, with humans controlling one half and zombies the other, and the kind of discrimination that would occur within Japan were something severe like this to happen."
On May 15, 2010 ''Helldriver'' began filming in an abandoned warehouse in Choshi, Japan. Other scenes involving hordes of zombies were filmed outside Mount Fuji.
''Helldriver'' had its world premiere at ''Fantastic Fest'' in Austin, Texas on September 28, 2010.
The film had its theatrical release in Japan on July 23, 2011. The screening of ''Helldriver'' at the New York Japan Society in April 2011 was a benefit in aid for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.
Film Business Asia gave the film a six out of ten rating, calling it a "average-to-occasionally-inspired effort" that was not as strong as Nishimura's ''Tokyo Gore Police'' but better than ''Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl''. The review went on to say that the film "suffers from the perennial problem with all zombie movies: the creatures have only one way of attacking and the heroes have only one way of killing - which soon becomes repetitive unless there's an interesting story or characters." The ''Hollywood Reporter'' gave the film a negative review, stating that "Even for a genre film, the storyline is negligible" and the "action choreography is run-of-the-mill." The review went on to praise the make-up in the film, stating that "Nishimura put tender loving care into image and costume design...Even "walk-ons" have distinct facial features and expressions."

'''''Pet Sematary''''' (sometimes referred to as '''''Stephen King's Pet Sematary''''') is a 1989 American horror film adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. Directed by Mary Lambert and written by King, the film features Dale Midkiff as Louis Creed, Denise Crosby as Rachel Creed, Blaze Berdahl as Ellie Creed, Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, and Fred Gwynne as Jud Crandall. Andrew Hubatsek was cast for Zelda's role. Author Stephen King has a cameo as a minister.
A sequel, ''Pet Sematary Two'', was released which was met with less financial and critical success.
The Creed family - Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage - move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home.
On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. After he dies, Pascow comes to Louis in the night and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is "sour". Louis awakens assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt.
During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat Church is run down on the highway in front of the house. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an abandoned Mi'kmaq|Micmac burial ground. Without explanation Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day Church comes back to life, though a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground as a boy, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet.
Sometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.
He tells him the story of a local named Bill Baterman who buried his son Timmy in the Micmac ground after he was killed in World War II. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying the townsfolk. A group of men including Jud tried destroying Timmy by lighting the Baterman house on fire, only for the deranged Bill to perish with his son. Jud insists that the burial ground is evil and Louis must never try to bury his son there.
After the funeral, Rachel and Ellie leave for Chicago while Louis remains home. Despite Pascow and Jud's warnings, Louis exhumes his son's body and buries him at the ritual site. In Chicago, Pascow appears to Ellie in a dream and warns her that Louis is about to do something terrible. Rachel is unnerved by her daughter's dream, but is only able to reach Jud when she calls, who tells her Louis is not home. She decides to return to Maine, much to Jud's alarm.
That night, Gage returns home and steals a scalpel from his father's bag. He taunts Jud before slashing his Achilles tendon and killing him. Rachel returns home and is lured into Jud's house by the voice and specter of her dead sister Zelda, only to discover that she is actually seeing Gage, holding a scalpel. In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her.
Waking up from his sleep, Louis notices Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers that his scalpel is missing. Receiving a phone call from Gage that he has "played" with Jud and Mommy, he fills two syringes with morphine and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection before entering the house. Gage taunts him further and Louis is startled by Rachel's corpse falling hanged from the attic before he is attacked by his son.
After a brief battle, Louis kills Gage with the morphine injection. He then lights the house on fire, leaving it to burn as he carries Rachel's body from the fire. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to "make it worse" but Louis, now grief-stricken to the point of insanity, believes that because Rachel was not dead as long as Gage was, burying her "will work this time". Pascow cries out in frustration and vanishes as Louis passes through him.
That night, the horribly mutilated Rachel returns to Louis and the couple embrace. Rachel takes a knife from the counter, and just as the screen cuts to black, Louis' screams of pain can be heard.

The film rights were sold to George A. Romero in 1984 for $10,000.  King had previously declined several other offers for a film adaptation.
The film's score was written by Elliot Goldenthal.[
The song "Pet Sematary" became one of the Ramones' biggest charting hits, reaching number four on the Billboard 'Modern Rock Tracks' list, despite being, in the words of AMG, "reviled by most of the band's hardcore fans".
The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that the film "defied the critics and opened at blockbuster levels".
The film grossed $57 million in North America.
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 43% of 23 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.2/10. Jason Jenkins rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it "one of the better King adaptations of the period".
A sequel, ''Pet Sematary Two'' was released in 1992.  A documentary, ''Unearthed & Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary'', premiered in September 2014, and was released in January 2017.

'''''Zombie Apocalypse''''' (or '''''2012: Zombie Apocalypse''''') is a film by Syfy and The Asylum starring Ving Rhames, Gary Weeks, Johnny Pacar, Robert Blanche, Anya Monzikova, Lesley-Ann Brandt and Taryn Manning. It was released on the Syfy channel on October 29, 2011. It was released on DVD on December 27, 2011.
The film begins by showing the previous six months in flashbacks.  In June 2011 a plague called the VM2 virus is first discovered in a French woman. Within the next 28 days, 83% of the population of Europe was infected. The virus becomes a global pandemic as it eventually reaches Japan, Philippines, and the United States. Six months later, the zombie plague has wiped out ninety percent of the population of the United States.
In the present, a trio of survivors comes down from a cabin to search a small town for food and news of survivors.  Ramona (Taryn Manning), Billie (Eddie Steeples), and Kevin (Gerald Webb) are ransacking an auto repair garage when the noise attracts a horde of zombies who attack.  Kevin is swarmed and bitten before another group of survivors consisting of Henry (Ving Rhames), Julian (Johnny Pacar), Cassie (Lesley-Ann Brandt), and Mack (Gary Weeks) intervene and stop the zombies.  Kevin, bitten and turning into a zombie, is dispatched by Cassie.  The group decides to head out together.  As they are traveling, Mack reveals they are headed to the island of Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina, supposedly a survivor camp.
The group stop at a strip mall and raid a surf shop for shoes and protective clothing.  They are attacked by a "runner" zombie which attracts a group of slower ones.  Cassie kills the runner and they escape out the rear of the store.  That night, they take refuge in a diner and the group shares a dinner together.  The next day the group heads to the "Human Safe Zone" at the high school.  Inside they find corpses littered around and no people.  In the gym they discover empty cots and realize the place was abandoned.  As they are searching the gym it is suddenly flooded with zombies that pour in from several doors.  During the melee Ramona is separated from the group and Billie is swarmed and bitten.  The group finds Ramona in the showers and tell her about Billie.
After leaving the school, the group takes a short cut through a small neighborhood and find a house that's on fire.  As Mack is about to be overtaken by a zombie an arrow hits it and a man with a bow grabs Mack.  The man takes Mack, Julian and Ramona with him.  Henry and Cassie are separated and run off without the others.  At a nearby safe house, the archers introduce themselves as Myrah, Brockton (Robert Blanche), and Sarah (Anya Monzikova).  They all confer to decide on a route to get to the ferry to Catalina.  Mack wants to go back for Henry and Cassie, Brockton tells them no.  They decide to follow the original route they were going to take in the hopes that everyone will find each other.  The next day the group sets out through the city.  Julian stops to use a portable toilet and finds a zombie hiding inside.  The group is swarmed and in the chaos Julian is bitten.  They hide from the zombies in a van and Julian reveals his bite to Mack.  He offers to sacrifice himself as a distraction but begins to turn before he can follow through.  The entire group is forced to hold him down while Mack breaks his neck.
Meanwhile, Henry and Cassie travel alone toward the ferry dock.  They decide to stay on the original path because they know where the others are going.  They encounter an abandoned army post and take some grenades.  Cassie uses a grenade to kill a pack of zombies following them and the explosion is close enough to distract the zombies surrounding the others in the van.  They take the opportunity to leave the van and head the opposite way.  The explosion attracts hordes of zombies to Henry and Cassie, who end up trapped on the roof of a building.  While on the roof they see Mack and the others on a nearby rooftop.  Cassie and Henry escape the rooftop and rejoin Mack's group.  The unified group is pursued through the streets toward the docks.  At the docks they find a sign about the ferry, instructions for quarantine, and food and water.  They also discover freshly killed bodies that have been dragged around.  The group is then suddenly attacked by a pair of infected tigers.  Brockton is killed and Henry is bitten.  Henry begs Cassie to finish him and she does.  As the movie closes, the survivors wait for the ferry and Mack is shown writing in Julian's diary.  In the final scene, the ferry approaches and blows its horn.

'''''The Book of Zombie''''' is a 2010 American independent horror film written by Erik Van Sant and directed by Scott Kragelund, Paul Cranefield and Erik Van Sant.  Brian Ibsen, Larisa Peters, Andrew Loviska, Paul Cantu, Bill Johns, Adrienne MacIain, Andy Evans, Adam Gehrke, and Elissa Dowling star as survivors of a Mormon-themed zombie attack.
On Halloween in a small, sleepy town in Utah, David Driscoll and Jenny King, who are involved in a relationship gone cold, try to settle down for a romantic evening, but they are visited by two Mormon missionaries, who seem to suffer from a small affliction. David shrugs them off with a few bad jokes and tries to resume his evening plans when the Mormons ring again - this time, as blood-thirsty zombies, along with several others who begin to overrun their neighborhood. After escaping their door-callers when one of them recoils from a soda thrown in his face, David decides to see an acquaintance, a convenience shop and bar owner named Harry Linderman, who owns a double-barrel shotgun. They reach the shop, only to meet a youth named Darwin Nedry and his substance-sniffing friend Charlie Cooper, who tell them that Linderman left with his gun after a phone call reached him from his medieval-themed bar, ''The Drunken Dragon''.
Not knowing how to retrieve their little daughter Charlotte, who is staying out of the house this night, without a weapon, David and Jenny decide to stay in the store for the time being. Soon, however, an armed, gritty hunter named Boothe Gardener stages a dramatic entrance into the store and stays for the night as well, following his own close brush with the zombified Mormon population in which his friend Charlie was killed. Owing to the incident at his house door, David concludes that the zombies are vulnerable to things which are taboo to Mormons, including caffeine. When a zombie breaks into the store, Gardener is mortally wounded after he tries to fight it off using non-caffeinated soda. Darwin destroys the zombie with caffeinated soda.
Forced to evacuate the store, David and company make for the ''Drunken Dragon'' but draw dozens of zombies. In the nick of time, they are led inside by armor-clad bartender Piper McKenzie, who tells them that Linderman was zombified during a zombie riot in the bar and is now kept locked up in a side room because she cannot bring herself to finish him. After discovering that Darwin keeps several explosive prank devices in his backpack, David devises a plan to reach Piper's car and get to his daughter by letting Linderman out, strapping the explosives and their scant soda supplies onto his back and using him as an involuntary suicide bomber to take out the zombies encroaching on the bar. The plan quickly goes awry when Linderman bites Darwin just after he is released, dooming him, before the youngster blasts his head with his own shotgun. Faced with no other choice, Darwin assumes the role of the bomber as a last heroic act, but he turns before he can light the fuse. Piper lights the explosives with a crossbow and fire arrow, but the blast proves too weak to take out all the zombies; before the door can be re-barricaded, the undead break into the bar and devour Piper alive, while Charlie faints.
Retreating into the main taproom, David and Jenny fight and destroy the undead, but by retreating too far, Jenny is caught by a zombie breaking through a window and mortally wounded. After promising Jenny that he will find their daughter, David hugs her until she dies, decapitates her to prevent reanimation, and then kills the remaining zombies in a berserk rage. As morning dawns, David staggers off, filled with revenge, to finish the undead, with an unsure Charlie in tow.
The film ends in some institution where a file labelled ''The Utah Project'' containing information about mutation warfare is presented to a group of boardroom-type people, followed by a file detailing an upcoming project ominously named ''The Vatican Solution''. As the file courier exits the boardroom, the camera backtracks his path to the reception of an office building, where a receptionist answers a phone call with the words, "Thank you for calling Church of Scientology. How may we help you?"

'''''El Retorno del Hombre Lobo''''' ('''''Return of the Wolfman''''') is a 1981 Spanish horror film that is the ninth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky, played by Paul Naschy. In the United States, the film was released theatrically and on VHS as ''The Craving'' in 1985, and more recently on DVD and Blu-ray as ''Night of the Werewolf''.
This was by far Naschy's favorite Hombre Lobo film, according to interviews. Naschy considered it a remake of his 1970 classic ''La Noche de Walpurgis'' (''Walpurgis Night''). The film had a much larger budget than previous Naschy werewolf productions.
Naschy followed this up with a sequel, ''La Bestia y la Espada Magica'' (''The Beast and the Magic Sword'').
Waldemar Daninsky is sentenced to be executed along with Elizabeth Bathory and a number of witches. Since it is nearly impossible to truly kill him, he is left in a kind of living death, with a silver dagger through his heart and an iron mask to keep him from biting. Centuries later, the dagger is removed and Daninsky returns to activity, fighting against a revived Elizabeth Bathory and her demonic manservant.

'''''Deadgirl''''' is a 2008 American black comedy horror film written by Trent Haaga and directed by Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel.  It stars Shiloh Fernandez and Noah Segan as teenage boys who discover a naked, female zombie, played by Jenny Spain.  When one wants to keep her as a sex slave and the other objects, their friendship is tested.
Rickie and J.T. are two high school seniors who gaze at the girls they wish they could get, especially Joann, the object of Rickie's affection, whom he has known since he was a child. One day, they decide to cut class and end up in an abandoned psychiatric hospital. They discover a mute, naked woman in the basement, chained to a table. While J.T. is interested in raping her, Rickie refuses and leaves. J.T. confronts Rickie the next day, and the two return to the basement where J.T. reveals that the woman is undead, which he discovered after attempting to kill her three times.
Rickie finds that J.T. invited their friend Wheeler to rape the woman, nicknamed "Deadgirl", as well, and decides that it is time to free her. He is able to cut the chain on one hand free before he hears J.T. and Wheeler approaching. He runs to hide, and J.T. begins to rape the woman. After he notices that her hand is free, the woman attacks him and scratches his face.
During gym class one day, Rickie asks Joann out on a date, knowing she has a boyfriend. She rejects him, and that afternoon, Joann's boyfriend Johnny and Johnny's friend Dwyer beat up Rickie and Wheeler. Wheeler rebuts that they "have their own pussy now" and don't need to hit on Joann. Johnny throws Rickie and Wheeler in his trunk, and he and Dwyer drive to the asylum to see Deadgirl. Rickie convinces Johnny to force Deadgirl to perform oral sex on him, and Deadgirl instead bites Johnny's penis, infecting him. The next day, Johnny races to the bathroom during class and his intestines burst out of his body, leaving him in the same undead state as Deadgirl.
Having figured out that this is an infectious, rotting disease, J.T. and Wheeler decide it is time to make a new Deadgirl with a fresh body. They lie in wait outside a gas station for a female victim. After an unsuccessful kidnapping and recovering from their beating, Joann shows up to confront them about Johnny. J.T. and Wheeler capture her and take her to the basement. Rickie heads to the basement with a machete to free Deadgirl and finds Joann and Deadgirl tied up to each other, encircled by J.T. and Wheeler. J.T. tries to convince Rickie to let Joann be bitten while Wheeler starts to feel up Joann. Rickie defends her by slicing Wheeler's hand off while Joann unties Deadgirl who feasts on Wheeler, then J.T.
Rickie and Joann flee through a stairwell door but cannot escape through the locked exterior entrance at the top of the stairs. Rickie runs off to find an escape route, and when he returns, Joann is not where he left her. Rickie returns to the basement and finds Deadgirl, who is about to attack him. She runs into him, knocking him down, breaks open the door and escapes to the outside. Rickie then sees Joann, who is about to collapse. He catches Joann as she falls, then sees that J.T. has stabbed her in the back. J.T. urges Rickie to let him bite her so she will live as undead. Rickie holds her for a moment, assuring her that he loves her and will save her. She coughs blood into his face, tells him to grow up, and asks for help. Later, a cleanly dressed Rickie lives normally as he walks outside in the direction of the asylum.  There, in the basement, surrounded by soft lights, tied lying in bed wearing clean lingerie, is his Deadgirl, Joann.

'''''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides''''' is a 2011 American fantasy swashbuckler film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series. It is the first film in the series not to be directed by Gore Verbinski, being replaced by Rob Marshall. Jerry Bruckheimer again served as producer. The film serves as a Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|stand-alone sequel to the previous installments. In the film, which draws its plot loosely from the novel ''On Stranger Tides'' by Tim Powers, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is joined by Angelica (Penélope Cruz) in his search for the Fountain of Youth, confronting the infamous pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane). The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released in the United States on May 20, 2011. It was the first film in the series to be released in the Disney Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D formats.
Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio first learned of Powers' novel ''On Stranger Tides'' during the back-to-back production of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End'', and considered it a good starting point for a new movie in the series. Pre-production started after the end of the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design. Principal photography rolled for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico, and California. Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film ''Avatar'', and ten companies were involved with the film's visual effects. Following inflated production costs it is currently noted as the most expensive film ever made.
''On Stranger Tides'' broke many box office records upon release, and it stands as the List of highest-grossing films|19th-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide when not adjusting for inflation. Critical reviews were mixed, with the film receiving criticism over its writing, directing, excessiveness, and lack of originality; positive mentions were given on the acting, action sequences, music, visuals, and the running time for being much shorter than the previous two films. A sequel, titled ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales'', is scheduled to be released on May 26, 2017.
After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs in London, Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II. The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy can locate it. Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing his leg and ship, the ''Black Pearl'', which he says was sunk, is heading the expedition.
Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, Captain Teague, who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is Angelica, Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard, who practices voodoo magic and wields the mythical "Sword of Triton" that controls his ship, the ''Queen Anne's Revenge''. While Jack is shanghaied aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.
Meanwhile, after a failed mutiny aboard the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a "one-legged man", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard Juan Ponce de León's missing flagship, the ''Santiago''. The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a mermaid's tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the ''Black Pearl'' was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken ships in bottles.
The ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.
Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the ''Black Pearl'', and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass, and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.
At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and her crew. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She retrieves the missing chalices and gives them to Jack, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.
With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to sacrifice herself. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Anticipating that the self-serving Blackbeard would sacrifice his daughter, Jack lied about which chalice contained the tear to save Angelica's life and Blackbeard's soul, although they were not happy that Jack tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body. Although Angelica claimed she loves Jack, he distrusts her intentions and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and returns to piracy.
Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the ''Revenge''. He reclaims the shrunken ''Black Pearl'' and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping to revert the ''Black Pearl'' to its original size.
In a post-credits scene, a voodoo doll of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by Angelica.

Shortly before the premiere of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End'', Jerry Bruckheimer stated it was the end of the trilogy, but the idea of a spin-off was still possible. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and only resumed in mid-2008.
In June 2009, Bruckheimer indicated Disney would prefer the fourth installment of ''Pirates '' to be released before ''The Lone Ranger#Planned Lone Ranger film|The Lone Ranger'' film, which he, Johnny Depp, Ted Elliott, and Terry Rossio had been working on for release on May 20, 2011. He hoped Gore Verbinski would return to direct the fourth film, as his ''BioShock#Canceled film|BioShock'' film adaptation had been put on hold.
Cook resigned in September 2009 after working for Disney for over 38 years. Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow: "When things went a little sideways on the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|first ''Pirates'' movie and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from the first moment. He trusted me".
During production of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest'' and ''At World's End'', writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel ''On Stranger Tides'', which they considered a good foundation on which to base "a new chapter" in the ''Pirates'' series. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, "but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." However, they denied that it would be a straight version of the novel: "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, "kind of a ''James Bond'' sort of thing", instead of the "designed to be a trilogy" structure of the previous installments. They hoped to "design a story that would support new characters," as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in ''At World's End'' caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.
Depp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being "involved in coming up with story lines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back." Among Depp's suggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists. Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot, and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.
Depp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that he would come back if the script was good.
New cast members include Ian McShane, who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film, Blackbeard, and Penélope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest.
Casting for mermaids required the actresses to have natural breasts-no implants. As Bruckheimer explained to ''EW'', "I don't think they had breast augmentation in the 1700s, [...] So it's natural for casting people to say, 'We want real people.'" were chosen for having "exotic sense, an otherworldly sensibility, but also under those layers a deadly quality", according to Marshall, and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks.
Principal photography began on June 14, 2010, in Hawaii. primarily at the Long Beach, California|Long Beach shore and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot, as the original Hawaiian location on Halona Blowhole#Halona Cove|Halona Cove was plagued with strong tides. After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico, with locations in both Palomino Island and the Castillo de San Cristóbal (Puerto Rico)|Fort of San Cristóbal in San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan, production moved to the United Kingdom in September, where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting. Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London, Knole House in Kent, and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich. Interiors were shot at London's Pinewood Studios, and a replica of an 18th-century London street was built on the backlot alongside the soundstages. In October, security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack.Smart, Gordon. . ''The Sun''. Retrieved October 9, 2010.
After the joint production of ''Dead Man's Chest'' and ''At World's End'' cost over $300 million, Disney decided to give a lower budget to the fourth installment. The tighter schedule-according to Bruckheimer, "We had a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks"-meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming. The British financial statements of the film revealed total expenditures of £240.7 million ($410.6 million) by 2013, with Disney receiving a rebate of $32.1 million from the British government, making ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'' the most expensive film ever made to date.
Bruckheimer said the decision to film in 3D was made due to its being "immersive filmmaking; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen." Bruckheimer described it as the first major "exterior movie" to be shot in 3D, as ''Avatar'' was mostly done in sound stages. At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. "You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure." While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, the decision was made to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion. The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for ''Avatar'', which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.
The ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' was built atop the ''Sunset'', the same ship used to depict the ''Black Pearl'' in previous installments. On February 2010, the ''Sunset'' was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms, where a big concern was to make it imposing, with three stories, without sacrificing actual seakeeping. Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic). Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that "not only Blackbeard was a dying man, but his ship is also a dying ship". The ship's figurehead also drew inspiration from Blackbeard's pirate flag.
''On Stranger Tides'' employed 1,112 shots of computer-generated imagery,
The Film score|film's score was written by Hans Zimmer, who had worked in all of the previous entries in the franchise; being the main composer for the second and third installments. Zimmer said that he tried to incorporate a rock n' roll sound, as he felt "pirates were the rock 'n' rollers of many, many years ago",

''On Stranger Tides'' has received mixed to negative reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 32% based on 259 reviews, with a rating average of 5 out of 10. The site's consensus was "It's shorter and leaner than the previous sequel, but this ''Pirates'' runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non-stop barrage of noisy action sequences." CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a B+ on an A+ to F scale.
Roger Ebert gave ''On Stranger Tides'' two out of four stars, saying that although the removal of Knightley and Bloom as well as the addition of Cruz were positive aspects, the film in general was "too much of a muchness" for him.
As with the previous films, the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing. ''The Arizona Republic'' critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five, stating that "the movie is a series of distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story. That never really happens."
Mike Scott from ''The Times-Picayune'' mentions that "while this latest chapter isn't quite sharp enough to restore the sense of discovery that made that first outing so darn exciting, it's enough to make up for most of the missteps that made the third one so darn arrgh-inducing."
''On Stranger Tides'' also had positive reviews; some critics found the film to be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story "pure cartoon, but a lot easier to follow than the other sequels", and summing as "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." Ray Bennett from ''The Hollywood Reporter'' considered that Marshall "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" and had "lively sexual tension" with Depp. Writing for ''The Globe and Mail'', Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a "fresh villain" whose "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". ''Variety's'' Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade."
The film was nominated for four Teen Choice Awards: Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie, Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actor, Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actress, and Villain.
On May 29, 2013, it was announced that ''Kon-Tiki (2012 film)|Kon-Tiki'' directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg would be directing ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales''.

'''The Dark Hour''' (original title: ''La Hora Fría'') is a Spanish science fiction film, produced in 2007, written and directed by Elio Quiroga, and produced by Eqlipse Producciones Cinematográficas with Margaret Nicoll, Jérôme Debève and Juan A. Ruiz as associate producers.
The film follows a group of eight people who living in a crumbling, unknown installation. They are survivors of a cataclysmic war. Maria (group leader), Pablo (her boyfriend), Jesus, Lucas, Mateo, Magda, and teen Ana all live together. Judas and Pedro (Maria's former lover) live away from the others. Jesus, the only young boy, films everything on a digicam. Jesus and Ana visit Judas in the basement whenever possible, as he treats them like adults. On the way to his rooms they pass decrepit corridors that are out of bounds, although Jesus leaves food for the "Solitary Child" that lives in the area.
Old TV sets show 1950s cartoons and science films with propaganda messages about destroying an unnamed enemy. Another film declares the enemy had developed a virus that destroys skin, making the infected victim constantly bleed but never die. 
The survivors can't leave the complex and live in fear of the "Strangers" and "Invisibles" (only seen as a green mist in the corridors). The survivors' only defense is to cut the complex's power and heat; the Dark (or Cold) Hour of the title. The "Strangers" are the infected mentioned in the propaganda films. When food, medical supplies and ammunition begin to run out they must travel to a supply depot outside of their underground safe zone.
Pablo, Pedro and Lucas are chosen to get the supplies. Pablo is frightened when a Stranger begins stalking them. Pedro uses the confusion to push Pablo into a room full of Strangers, letting him become infected. Pablo's death devastates Maria and makes the other survivors question their future. Mateo wonders if it would be better if the group made a suicide pact instead of face such a bleak future. 
The complex is then invaded by the Invisibles. Ana stumbles into the green mist and frantically tries to get into another room. Mateo rescues her and they kiss briefly.
The next day the Solitary Child shows up because his home was overrun by Strangers. As he is cleaned up by the children the others organize an attack on the Strangers. Magda learns of Mateo and Ana's kiss and slaps him for taking advantage. During the attack Mateo and Lucas are infected and killed by their comrades. A Stranger slips past them, though, and chases the children until he touches Jesus. The children escape and hide in a fridge until the others rescue them. Pedro wants to kill Jesus, but is stopped by the others. Unlike everyone else Jesus doesn't become infected. Maria later finds Pedro who has become paranoid and talks about the voices behind the walls. Maria tackles him and a shotgun is heard going off. Magda, Judas and the children find an armed Pedro and an injured Maria. While they talk Pedro stares into the distance, watching the Invisibles come up behind the survivors.
Pedro walks into the green lights while the others run away, supporting Maria. As they run they shoot at the lights. Coming to a garage Judas opens the doors and they run outside for the first time, where it's nighttime. They drop their weapons and sit in a town square, surrounded by Strangers. Jesus looks into his digicam and says they will have to join the Strangers, but at least it won't hurt.
Jesus looks at the sky where the Earth suddenly rises over the buildings. As the camera pulls back it's revealed that the complex is under a geodesic dome on the moon. The Earth is clearly surrounded by debris and is shown to be completely shattered to the core.

'''''Juan of the Dead''''' ( in 2010. Coproduction by La Zanfoña Producciones (España), Producciones de la 5ta Avenida (Cuba), with the participation of the ICAIC Canal Sur and Televisión Española. The film won the Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film in 2012.
Juan (Alexis Díaz de Villegas) is forty years old and has devoted the majority of his life to living in Cuba doing absolutely nothing. He is accompanied by his bumbling sidekick, Lazaro (Jorge Molina Enríquez|Jorge Molina), who is just as lazy but the bigger fool (and accident-prone), on a makeshift fishing raft. Their line snags what they think is a corpse but it suddenly awakens and attacks them, ending with Lazaro shooting it in the head with his spear gun. They think nothing of it at first and go about their business as usual, which involves thuggish activity and associating with their less than reputable friends: Lazaro's vain, Americanized pretty-boy son Vladi California; drag queen La China, who is also an expert slingshot marksman; and China's black, hulk-like lover Primo (who faints at the sight of blood and has to wear a blindfold when fighting).
The only emotional bond Juan has is with his daughter Camila (Andrea Duro), a young and beautiful girl who wants nothing to do with her father because the only thing he does is get in trouble. Suddenly a strange series of events begin to occur: people everywhere suddenly become violent and attack each other at random. After an encounter with an elderly neighbor's reanimated body, Juan comes to the conclusion that it is not vampires nor possession by demons, but capitalist dissidents. Lazaro attempts to flee with a woman he and the others have rescued, but Juan follows him to the raft they are trying to escape on. The woman falls into the water and is lost to them, leaving Lazaro with little reason to refuse Juan's plea for him to stay, and that Juan needs his sidekick.
To Camila's dismay, Juan's idea to take advantage of the situation is revealed: He starts a business, which he rationalizes will also be a great help for other survivors, with the slogan: "Juan of the Dead: we kill your beloved ones. How can we help you?" For a price, the five men in the group enter homes and slay the zombified residents. Although extremely proficient in dispatching their quarry in open streets, they suffer from bad luck and high civilian and resident casualties on indoor missions. That, coupled with allowing their corruption to come out (by looting and even attacking humans that Lazaro claims owe him money) puts strain both on his relationship with his daughter, and the success of their business.
The group is later rounded up by a shady military group, forcing them to strip naked and get into a truck. It seems they are recruiting able-bodied males to fight the zombie threat but some of the others who were rounded up before were infected, and they reanimate, causing a riot in the back of the truck and flipping it over, enabling Juan's group to flee, and further blunders on the military's part remove any hope they have of any kind of rescue or victory over the undead. China, who was bitten during the truck incident, dies and reanimates while handcuffed to Juan, and Vladi and Camila struggle to figure out a way to extricate Juan from his predicament. Juan finally throws China off the roof of their safe haven and Camila throws him some oil to lubricate zombie China's hand, letting him slip out of the cuffs and fall.
The zombies have become too numerous to continue the group's business operations, forcing them to stay on rooftops for safety, sending Vladi out on one-man food retrieval missions which endears him to Camila. At this point the group is whittled down to Juan, Lazaro, Primo, Vladi, and Camila, the latter two having become romantically involved despite Juan's disapproval. Losing hope, they decide to try heading for the mountains which may be unpopulated and safer. An escape attempt via motor vehicle is thwarted by mechanical failure (and the fact that none of them knows how to drive), forcing them to flee on foot while pursued by hundreds of undead. Attempting to seek shelter in a bunker, yet another of Juan's ideas proves disastrous, as Primo, while prying open the door, reveals it is overrun and he is pulled in.
The remaining group makes their way to a basketball court where a miraculous feat of vehicular zombie-slaying by a middle-aged white man with a harpoon gun mounted on his truck saves them after they become surrounded. He tries to tell the group what he knows about the situation in English, but the language barrier between them prevents him from divulging his plan to end the disaster, which he believes has religious implications. He is then accidentally killed by another of Lazaro's spear gun incidents, forcing the desperate group to come up with yet another plan for escape, and berating Lazaro for his continual screw-ups.
Sheltering in a deserted parking garage the man had led them to, Lazaro amazingly comes up with a plan to make up for his repeated failures. According to his idea, they construct a flotation mechanism out of empty oil drums and attach them to a convertible, with the intention of attempting to drive through a group of zombies on the street and out onto the beach, where they can reach the water. They plan to float to Florida (where Camila's mother is known to be staying), hoping America might be safer. Lazaro confides to Juan that he had been bitten during their earlier escape, and they share an emotional goodbye while they wait for him to change, until it's revealed it was only a harmless scratch.
Juan and Lazaro fight the zombies standing in their way to clear a path to the water for the car to drive over. Juan hears a child's crying and goes to investigate. He rescues a little boy from his zombified father and brings him to the car. Lazaro and Juan create a ramp of bodies for the car to jump over the wall separating the street from the sand, and the car makes it into the water. Preparing to float to freedom, the group is shocked when Juan gets out of the floating car and heads back to shore, explaining to his comrades that he belongs in his homeland and convincing them that he's going to do what he's always done best: Survive.
The end credits are an animated cartoon showing Juan going through the horde of zombies. It is later shown that Camila, Lazaro and Vladi came back to join Juan in fighting the dead.

The film was first shown at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. Focus Features released the film on 14 August via iVOD and VOD, along with DVD and Blu-ray Disc.
''Total Film'' gave the film three stars out of five, noting the film's "jaunty tone bristling uneasily with often unlikeable heroes" but praised its political context, stating that the film "resurrects the genre's political subtexts with jibes at a country where zombies are dismissed as 'dissidents' and public transport continues to run, no matter what."

'''''The Horror of Party Beach''''' is a 1964 American horror film in the beach party genre, directed by B-movie maven Del Tenney, which Tenney himself described as "a take-off on beach parties and musicals".
''The Horror of Party Beach'' is considered to be one of the worst films of all time.
At a small East Coast beach town, a boat dumps radioactive toxic waste into the ocean, which lands on a sunken ship and the skeletons of shipwrecked dead sailors. The skeletons and water plants are mutated by the waste, transforming into half-human, half-fish monsters that make their way to the surface.
Hank Green, an employee of scientist Dr. Gavin, attends a beach party with his immature girlfriend, Tina. Tina is drinking alcohol, and, when Hank disapproves, they argue. The party catches the attention of a motorcycle gang. Tina flirts with the leader, Mike, while Hank talks with Dr. Gavin's young-adult daughter Elaine. When Hank tries to take Tina away, Mike fights him. Hank wins, and Tina apologizes to Hank, but he leaves. Mike is taken home by his gang. Tina swims to some rocks far away from the beach, where one of the monsters kills her. The sight of her body causes commotion on the beach.
After Tina's death, Elaine worries about Hank but is reassured by her father. Eulabelle, Dr. Gavin's housekeeper, suggests that some kind of voodoo is responsible for Tina's death. Gavin refuses to believe this. Later that night, Elaine cancels going to a slumber party with her friends. The monsters, whose numbers have increased, attack the slumber party and kill most of the girls. This news spreads quickly.
Three female travelers drive through the town on their way to New York. Their car's tire goes flat near Fingel's Quarry. While attempting to fix the tire, they are killed by the monsters. One of the monsters, stalking two girls in town, is enraged when they are picked up before it can kill them. The monster, noticing a clothing store with female mannequins on display, breaks the window with a punch, ripping off its arm. Dr. Gavin and Hank study the severed arm, which is still alive, and they cannot figure out how to kill it. Eulabelle accidentally spills a container of metallic sodium on the arm, which kills it, giving the scientists a way of destroying the monsters.
Dr. Gavin and Hank search for the monsters. After discovering that the monsters can be tracked by their trail of radioactive water, Hank drives to New York City to obtain sodium. Dr. Gavin initially has no luck in finding the monsters. Eulabelle tells him that Elaine went to look for the monsters at Fingel's Quarry. Dr. Gavin rushes off to help Elaine, bringing a small case of sodium with him. Elaine tests the water for radioactivity, and the monsters chase her. She trips between two rocks and injures her leg. Dr. Gavin arrives and throws sodium at the monster attacking Elaine, killing it. Another monster attacks, but Dr. Gavin is out of sodium and must defend his daughter himself. Hank, who is bringing more sodium, is stopped by a police officer, who leads him to Fingel's Quarry. Hank saves Dr. Gavin by killing the monster attacking him, and the group kills the remaining monsters.
Hank visits Elaine, who is recovering from her leg injury.

The film's working title was ''Invasion of the Zombies''. 
Unlike the beach party movies filmed up to that time, this film was shot in black and white and on the Atlantic coast. Produced in Stamford, Connecticut, the beach scenes were filmed in an area of town called Shippan Point, and shot over a period of three weeks.
The biker gang in the film was played by the Charter Oak Motorcycle Club of Riverside, Connecticut.
The monsters for the film were constructed at Gutzon Borglum's sculpting studio in Stamford. There were two monster suits, and when they dried, one was too small for the stuntman. Production assistant Ruth Glassenberg Freedman had a son, Charles Freedman, who was 16 at the time. He fit perfectly into the suit and thus portrayed a monster in the film.
The "underwater" transformation scene of the monsters was actually shot on a stage with images of fish in an aquarium superimposed over the dissolving stage shots. Chocolate syrup was used for blood during the monster attack scenes.
The original theatrical release of the film paired it with another Del Tenney feature, ''The Curse of the Living Corpse'', in a studio-sanctioned double feature.
''The Horror of Party Beach'' interview with Del Terrey, ''The Del Tenney Double Feature'' DVD, UPC 030306773193.
The advertising for the double feature of ''Horror of Party Beach'' and ''Living Corpse'' capitalized on a gimmick first utilized by director William Castle, in which some newspaper advertisements included a call-out that stated: "For your protection! We will not permit you to see these shockers unless you agree to release the theater of all responsibility for death by fright!" Theaters were encouraged by the distributor to have patrons sign a "Fright Release" before they took their seats. The trailer for the double feature also included this claim.
Although billed in its promotional material as "The First Horror Monster Musical," all the songs heard in the film were presented as either soundtrack music or source music, as opposed to the style of a traditional musical with songs sung by central characters of the story. Ray Dennis Steckler's ''The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies'' also made the same claim a few months earlier.
As a tie-in, a monographic fumetti comic book by Wally Wood and Russ Jones detailing the film's story was released by the Warren Publishing Company under its Famous Films masthead. It had a 35-cent cover price.
Edward Earle Marsh (aka Zebedy Colt) composed the film's soundtrack; Wilfred Holcombe was credited as the musical director. Marsh and Holcombe wrote three songs that were performed in the film: "Joy Ride", "The Zombie Stomp" and "You Are Not a Summer Love."
Gary Robert Jones and Ronnie Linares, both of The Del-Aires (a Paterson, New Jersey rock band who play themselves as a local band), wrote one song together, "Drag," and one song each: "Wigglin' Wobblin'" (Jones) and "Elaine" (Linares). The Del-Aires performed all six songs in the film.
''The Horror of Party Beach'' was included as one of the choices in the 1978 book ''The Fifty Worst Films of All Time''.
Movie-mocking television series ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' featured ''The Horror of Party Beach'' in one of its season 8 episodes in 1997.
Punk band Sloppy Seconds's song "The Horror of Party Beach", appearing on their 1989 album ''Destroyed'', detailed the plot of the movie.

'''''Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies''''' is a 2012 American action horror B movie directed by Richard Schenkman, with a screenplay by Schenkman based upon the story concept of Karl Hirsch and Lauren Proctor. Produced by The Asylum, and starring Bill Oberst Jr., the film was released direct-to-video on May 29, 2012, following its May 28 theatrical premiere screening at the Telfair Museum of Art Jepson Center in Savannah, Georgia.
In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, the film is a mockbuster of the 20th Century Fox film ''Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (film)|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter''.
After his mother Nancy Lincoln (Rhianna Van Helton), falls victim to an illness that requires her to be tied to her bed, vicious and cannibalistic, 10-year-old Abe Lincoln (Brennen Harper) sees his father Thomas Lincoln (Kent Igleheart) commit suicide at her bedside. Taking up a scythe, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak.
When an adult Abraham Lincoln (Bill Oberst Jr.) has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established secret service to accompany him in investigating the fort.
They get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivors led by General Stonewall Jackson (Don McGraw) as well as by several of the infected people. Abe kills one of his men who had been bitten by an infected and explains to the others in his party that if they are bitten or scratched by an infected, or if an infected's blood makes contact with their mouths or eyes, that they too will become infected and, within twenty-four hours, would no longer be considered "human". More are lost when attempting to investigate the surrounding neighborhood, and Abe encounters an old flame turned prostitute Mary Owens (Baby Norman) who is sheltering her help, including a young Theodore Roosevelt (Canon Kuipers), daughter Sophia (Hannah Bryan) and prostitute Annika (Anna Fricks) to protect them from the invasion.
The group makes their way back to the fort where Jackson refuses to kill the infected, believing them to only be sick and in need of care. He claims Lincoln's actions are only against the members of the Confederacy. Based on an old Bantu word he'd learned from his mother, Agent Brown (Jason Hughley) names the infected persons "zombies". Pat Garrett (Christopher Marrone) volunteers to help Abe, and guides them to a nearby plantation that has farming implements and other weapons they can use to combat the threat.
When returning to the fort, Mary is splashed in the face with zombie blood and soon falls ill. Meanwhile, agent John Wilkinson (Jason Vail) protests the killing and asks to remain behind as the rest of the group heads into the township to kill off the infected. Being greatly outnumbered, only Abe, Theodore, and Sophia return when the others are slaughtered. Wilkinson, who is revealed to be a spy, plots to kill Lincoln while he's alone but changes his mind when he catches Abe praying, as in his mind prayer would ensure Lincoln's soul going to heaven. After being convinced by Pat Garrett that Lincoln is right and escape is unlikely, Stonewall shows Abe a secret cache of gunpowder. They then decide to use the explosive to blow up the fort after trapping and containing the zombies inside. When the fuse goes out, Stonewall ventures down alone to re-light it, but is over-run and killed by the zombies just after doing so. Abe and Brown escape just in time and the entire place goes up. Mary accepts her fate and goes off with Lincoln to die, much to Sophia's heartbreak.
Eighteen months later, Abe goes to visit Mary who had been in the care of a doctor investigating the illness in vain hope of finding a cure. As Abe cleans wounds caused by her restraining shackles, Mary grabs his hand scratches his skin infecting him, much to his horror, forcing him to kill her. Knowing he is himself uncurable, Abe requests that a message be sent to John Wilkinson, as earlier he'd discovered that Wilkinson was actually John Wilkes Booth who had a plot to kidnap Lincoln in response to the end of the war and the Union the victor. The message gives Booth the information to know exactly where Lincoln would be the following night as Abe and his wife Mary go to the theater, thus leading to his assassination (purposely arranged by Lincoln to prevent another outbreak) at Booth's hands.

The choice of Bill Oberst Jr. in the lead role of Abraham Lincoln in ''Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies'' has been praised, with criticisms otherwise aimed at the film's plot, supporting cast members, character development, and historical inaccuracies.
Jason Adams of JoBlo wrote that the film was what might be anticipated from The Asylum, in its being "extremely repetitive" and having a script filled with "terrible lines."  Adams stated that the actors "pretty much suck post-colonial wastewater", except for Bill Oberst Jr.

 is a 2011 Japanese zombie film written and directed by John Cairns, as his first feature film. The film screened at Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival and the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in 2011 and the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal in 2012.
When all the men in her small town turn into zombies and begin to attack the women, Japanese schoolgirl Sakura (Higarino) finds her life turned upside down. The trauma of witnessing the mass murder of her female friends and family members pushes her toward madness.
Having few skills and armed only with her English textbook and a ''kyudo'' bow, she sets out to survive. Having visions of a red-headed boy named Billy (Max MacKenzie), a character from one of her books, drives her toward insanity and she begins to lose her grip on reality. She wanders about, narrowly escaping her own death, until she finds Aoi (Mai Tsujimoto), a woman who is both equipped and mentally ready to kill. But this woman is dangerous and, rather than support, offers violence and more punishment. Seeking the real-life version of Billy, Sakura must decide whether to survive and find the answers or give up and die.Some text adapted from the , released under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation License

Director John Cairns has been living in Japan for over ten years.  The film was developed during the 2010 NAFF IT Project.
Its world premiere was July 15, 2011, at the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BiFan) in July 2011, and it screened there again in July 2012.
''L'Écran Fantastique'' described ''Schoolgirl Apocalypse'' as an "alternative" zombie film. "A skillful and effective road movie at the intersection of ''28 Days Later'' and ''The Road''...a great surprise sure to delight alternative zombie movie fans."
The film was also described as genre-changing by the German online film review magazine ''Manifest''. They stated that it is daring for an American film director to use exaggerated western clichés for a Japanese horror-genre film. They called the film "a liberating 'fuck you', a surprisingly serious and decelerated undead Armageddon." Sound design was favorably compared to ''Poltergeist II: The Other Side|Poltergist II'', but they faulted the director for his restrained gore. They also stated that while the project was filmed in rural areas near Mount Fuji, the famous landmark did not appear in the film, which was an intentional choice by the director to avoid clichés. They concluded by stating that while the film had too little action and no blood, it was a good movie, and rated it 4 out of 5 stars.
''News-Gate'' wrote that an important criterion for a successful horror film would include "savage monsters and beautiful heroine," and that the film's plot of heroine and boy versus an epidemic was taken from a comic book by Tomohiro Koizumi.
''Djuna'' noted that this was director John Cairns' first feature film, and developed in 2010 through support of the Network of Asian Fantastic Films (NAFF). They wrote that the film's beginning and title might lead viewers to feel the film was to be simply a "Japanese schoolgirls killing zombies" film, but it took off in an unexpected direction. They also noted that the film was a bit garbled, the political metaphors were too strong, and it did not contain as much action as might have been expected. Overall, the response was positive, and they rated the film 2 stars out of 3.

'''''Sella Turcica''''' is a 2010 horror film written and directed by Fred Vogel, and co-written by Shelby Vogel and Don Moore.
While serving in the Middle East, Sergeant Bradley Roback and his squad vanished while on patrol, their equipment and vehicles being found abandoned, with no signs of a struggle. Days after their disappearance, Brad and ten of the other twelve missing soldiers turned up unconscious outside of their base. When the men woke up in the LRMC in Germany, they were found to be suffering from unexplainable physical impairments. Brad lost the ability to walk, taste and see in color, and is plagued by frequent and severe headaches that are exacerbated by high-pitched noise.
Brad is sent home to his family, where his condition causes some tension, something not helped by his sister Ashley's insensitive boyfriend, Gavyn. As hours pass, Brad's body and mind deteriorate. He has periods of unresponsiveness, suffers from seizures, a wound on his right foot worsens, he becomes more gaunt, his eyes and tongue swell, his fingernails and teeth yellow, and he begins expelling a black fluid from his ears, mouth and anus. In the morning after his return, Brad is found by his mother, Karmen, ingesting a large amount of salt in the kitchen, having apparently entered the room under his own power. As his mother gets his wheelchair from the parlor, Brad returns to his bed, and becomes semi-catatonic, refusing to move and denying that he needs to go to a hospital when his brother Bruce suggests it.
When Gavyn stops by, his blunt comments about Brad's condition and his relationship with Ashley sparks a fight between him and Bruce. After Bruce goes outside to cool off, and gets into an argument with his mother in the yard, Brad (who has just killed and ate the family dog, Fulci) wheels into the kitchen, stands up, and attacks Gavyn. Gavyn's screams alert Bruce and Karmen, who find him dead from severe head trauma, and Brad convulsing on the floor. As Bruce tries to revive Brad, Ashley (who had just arrived home from dance practice) leads their mother out of the room. As soon as Ashley and Karmen leave, Brad springs to life, rips Bruce's lower jaw off, and clumsily stumbles after his mother and sister, emitting animalistic noises.
Brad finds Ashley and Karmen, and kills the former by punching through a door and impaling her through the neck on the splintered wood, subsequently ripping her head off. As Brad struggles to get to her, Karmen bludgeons him with a metal wall ornament, prompting a slug-like creature to burst out of his sella turcica (seemingly confirming Brad's earlier, sarcastic theory that he and his squad were abducted and experimented on by aliens). Karmen beats Brad and the entity to death, and the film ends with home movies of the Robacks, and Karmen's husband returning home to discover his wife has hanged herself in the garage.

Moria awarded ''Sella Turcica'' two and a half stars out of five, finding the characters well-rounded and the drama and performances compelling, but the finale unsatisfying, stating it "is the point where the film goes from a well-established character ensemble about people reacting to a family member becoming ill to a predictable gore bloodbath" and that the effects were "impressively gore-drenched but not always the most convincing".
Arrow in the Head had a lukewarm reaction to ''Sella Turcica'', writing "It tries really hard. It does. Unfortunately its dramatic portion is overwrought and its gore freak-out ending feels like a cheat to make the movie more memorable than it deserves to be, even if said gore is fantastic".

'''''Doom''''' is a 2005 science fiction action horror film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and written by David Callaham and Wesley Strick, loosely based on the video game series of the same name created by id Software. Starring Karl Urban and Dwayne Johnson, the film follows a group of Marines in a research facility on Mars. After arriving on a rescue and retrieval mission after communications ceased, the Marines soon battle genetically engineered monsters plaguing the facility.
After film rights deals with Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures expired, Warner Bros. lost the rights, which were subsequently given back to Universal, who started production in 2004. The film was an international co-production of the United States, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, and Germany.
In an interview with executive producer John Wells, he stated that a second film would be put into production if the first was a success at the box office.http://www.slasherama.biz/features/doom.HTML   The film grossed $28.2 million in North America and $27.8 million overseas for a worldwide total of $56 million; based on a $60 million budget, the film was a box office bomb.
In the year 2046, a heavily populated research facility on Mars is suddenly attacked by an unknown assailant. Following a distress call sent by Dr. Todd Carmack, a group of Marines, led by Asher "Sarge" Mahonin, is sent on a search-and-rescue mission. One of the Marines, John "Reaper" Grimm, accompanies his sister, Dr. Samantha Grimm, to one of the labs within the devastated sector to retrieve data; here he learns that the dig site where their parents were accidentally killed was re-opened and ancient skeletons of a genetically enhanced race were discovered.
While searching for survivors in the facility, the Marines find Dr. Carmack, who is taken to a medical room for examination, but later disappears. The Marines find a creature that leads them down to the facility's sewer. Marine Eric "Goat" Fantom is killed during their pursuit, along with the creature. The corpses of Goat and the creature are taken to the medical room. Marine Gregory "Duke" Schofield stays with Sam as she starts an autopsy, when they are attacked by a second creature. After trapping it, Sam continues the autopsy on the first creature, finding that its organs are human. Goat suddenly revives, and then kills himself by slamming his head against a glass window.
The squad tracks a third creature down into the dig site, where it kills three more Marines. Sam and Reaper try to convince Sarge that the creatures are humans from the facility, mutated by the addition of a Martian chromosome (called C24) they found and synthesized from the bones discovered, and that not all of those infected will fully transform into creatures. Regardless, Sarge orders his team to sanitize the entire facility. Sarge kills the creature in the medical lab (revealed to be a mutated Dr. Carmack) and executes one of his Marines for defying his commands. Sam and the surviving Marines are then flanked by the infected, partly mutated, humans. Only Sam and a wounded Reaper escape. Sam injects Reaper with the C24 serum, enhancing his abilities so that he is able to kill the infected humans and fully mutated creatures. Reaper then battles an infected Sarge and kills him. Having survived, Sam and Reaper enter the elevator to leave the facility.

The film's producer, John Wells, admitted in an interview that "many" video game movie adaptations had "sucked." He revealed that the crew was able to get "a lot of financial support from Universal" and that it wasn't "done on the cheap." Wells also revealed that the ''Doom'' movie would have a sequence shot in a first-person perspective because "''Doom'' without that would be a miscarriage of justice!"
Wells also revealed that "we were all very concerned that we make sure that it was exactly the kind of experience that we [the crew] remembered so fondly from the game: turning the lights off at midnight, cranking it up and scaring the hell out of yourself!"
Wells further stated that there is a balance between computer-generated imagery|CGI and prosthetics in the ''Doom'' movie, and he, for the first time as a producer, admitted that "we didn't wanna rely on the CGI. Those effects still haven't ''quite'' got to the level where you fully believe it — certainly not for long periods of time," and that the crew used Stan Winston's Creature Shop and that his work is only "enhanced with CGI." He also admitted that "if you rely too much on CGI it can look cheesy: it doesn't quite work. It'll get there, but it's not there yet."
Wells has stated that the crew insisted that the ''Doom'' movie be made into an R-rated movie and that he didn't "think it was possible to do a PG-13 version-and that's been the mistake made by a couple of other computer game movies," and that "a lot of studios didn't want to do it. But we made a conscious decision that we'd prefer not to make it any other way."
Wells also revealed that if this first ''Doom'' film is successful, a second one could be made, and that "we certainly have some ideas for the next one, if there is gonna be one. We'll have to wait and see: the audience will have to tell us ..."
One of the most noteworthy aspects of the film is a short sequence near the end of the film where the camera follows the progress of Grimm from a first-person perspective in homage to the original game. In the words of Karl Urban, the actor who plays Reaper:
:"In some ways, it makes cinematic history in that, for the first time, the audience becomes the hero of the film."
:"When we go into FPS, the audience is doing the rampage, the audience is doing the work and that is so cool. It's insane!"
* November 27, 2003 — ''Computer Gaming World'' printed an article on their website regarding the ''Doom'' movie. It states that Warner Bros. is indeed working on the ''Doom'' movie and has placed it on the fast track. A revised script was submitted to id Software and approved; John Wells (producer of ''ER'') and Lorenzo di Bonaventura (who introduced ''The Matrix'' to Warner Bros.) have signed on to work on the ''Doom'' movie.

It did well on its opening weekend, taking in $15.5 million. However, it quickly dropped in its second week in theaters and the final gross of the film was only $28.2 million domestically and almost $56 million worldwide, with a budget of $60 million. The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor (Dwayne Johnson), but lost to Rob Schneider for ''Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo''.
In a 2009 interview, Johnson described the film as an example of "trying and failing" to do a good video game adaptation, and that it was a cautionary tale of what "not to do".http://www.mtv.com/news/2459007/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-honestly-discusses-infamous-doom-movie/
''Doom'' was released on DVD on February 7, 2006, HD DVD on April 26, 2006 and on Blu-ray Disc on February 10, 2009.
The film's score was composed by Clint Mansell, upon which he produced a remix of the Nine Inch Nails song "You Know What You Are?", which was used in the film's ending credits. The song "Switchback" by Celldweller was licensed to be used for marketing and media purposes, such as the theatrical trailer and TV spots.

'''''Mortuary''''' is a 2005 American zombie film directed by Tobe Hooper. It stars Dan Byrd, Alexandra Adi and Denise Crosby. This film has no connection to the 1983 film of the same name.
After the loss of their father, the Doyle family - Leslie, Jonathan, and Jamie - move to the Fowler Mortuary in hope of starting a new life but find it in poor condition. Jonathan goes to the local diner where he meets Cal and his two girlfriends, Tina and Sara. Cal tells Jonathan about the legend of Bobby Fowler, an abused and deformed boy who lived in the mortuary. Jonathan also meets Liz, a local girl; Grady, Liz's best friend; and Rita, Liz's aunt, who employed her to work at the diner. Jonathan, Liz, and Grady become friends quickly. That night, Cal, Sara and Tina go to the graveyard outside the mortuary and vandalize it; they then go into one of the crypts, where they are attacked by Bobby Fowler.
The next day, Jonathan, Liz and Grady go back to Jonathan's house, where Grady gives them drugs. Shortly afterwards, Sheriff Howell shows up to welcome Leslie to the town. He informs her about his attempt to stop "graveyard babies". He also is looking for Cal, Sara, and Tina. Sheriff Howell investigates the crypts, where Bobby Fowler infects him. The next day at the diner, Jonathan and Liz are working, when Cal and Sara arrive messy. Cal has a rage attack and Sara begins vomiting black ooze. Rita comes in to calm her down but is infected in the process. At the mortuary, Leslie performs her first embalming. While doing so, she  makes a mess of the embalming fluids. While going to clean it up, one of the bodies gets up and infects Leslie. Jonathan, Jamie, Liz, and Grady return to Jonathan's house for dinner, where Leslie, now infected with the mysterious ooze, has prepared a sort of ooze soup. The four notice a black fungus growing on the wall. Liz pours salt in her soup which makes it bubble and sends Leslie into a rage in which she attacks Jonathan and Jamie. Liz and Grady quickly escape.
Shortly afterwards, Jonathan fights off his mother and saves Jamie. The four escape outside but are forced to retreat into a crypt, because they are chased there by an infected man. The four make the shocking discovery that Bobby lives in the crypt and dug tunnels under the cemetery. They find Tina, who is still alive, but are attacked by the mother. They find a ladder which leads back into the house, where they barricade themselves. They question Tina and eventually cut her hand to see if her blood has turned into the black ooze, a sign of the infection. Sheriff Howell assaults the house a shotgun. Tina goes into the kitchen to clean the wound but is infected by contaminated water. Grady accidentally pours salt on her, burning her. The group now knows the weakness of the infected, but their victory is short-lived after they find that Jamie, who Jonathan had left in her room to keep her safe, has been captured.
Shortly after entering the tunnels, they  see and hear things; a hand suddenly punches through Grady's chest, giving him enough time to say quietly, "run", before dying. They soon find the source, a well filled with black ooze. Shortly thereafter, Jamie is found, but captured by Bobby Fowler and taken back to the lair, where they confront him by throwing salt in the well. Cal is killed by getting his head blown off by the Sheriff, and the other infected are burned with salt; Bobby is sucked in and the three escape the house. The three, happy to escape but still grieving the deaths of Leslie and Grady, are about to leave the house, but Jonathan is pulled underground, and Leslie, alive again, pulls Jamie into the house, and Liz's fate is left untold.

The following is a '''list of zombie short films''' and other zombie- and undead-related projects, such as television series.
Zombies are creatures usually portrayed as either reanimated corpses or mindless human beings, in both cases cannibalistic or more widely as undead bodies, ghouls, mummies, reanimated corpses, vampires and so on. While zombie films generally fall into the horror genre, some cross over into other genres, such as comedy, science fiction, thriller, or romance. Distinct subgenres have evolved, such as the "zombie comedy" or the "zombie apocalypse". Zombies in ''this'' article are not distinct from other types of undead like ghouls, ghosts, mummies, or vampires.

'''''Urban Decay''''' is a 2007 horror film directed by Harry Basil and starring Dean Cain.
Cab driver Stan slams into a homeless man who gets up and walks away, leaving behind a scarf covered with writhing maggots. Obsessed with the mystery, Stan hunts the ragtag figure through the city, discovering a trail of mangled, half-eaten victims, and an urban legend: Puss Head was a sewer worker who came back from an uncharted tunnel changed into something both living and dead. Parents warn their children that the shuffling zombie will get them if they stay out on the streets too late. But as the body count rises, Stan finds that the legend is alive and hungry.

'''''Plan 9 from Outer Space''''' (originally titled '''''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''''') is a 1959 independently made American black-and-white science fiction-horror film, written, produced, directed, and edited by Ed Wood, that stars Gregory Walcott, Mona McKinnon, Tor Johnson, and Vampira. The film also posthumously bills Bela Lugosi as a star (silent footage of the actor had actually been shot by Wood for another, unfinished film just prior to Lugosi's death in August 1956). ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' was released theatrically in 1959 by Distributors Corporation of America (as Valiant Pictures).
The storyline concerns extraterrestrials who are seeking to stop humanity from creating a doomsday weapon that could destroy the universe. The aliens implement "Plan 9", a scheme to resurrect the Earth's dead, referred to as "ghouls". By causing chaos, the aliens hope the crisis will force humanity to listen to them. If not, the aliens will then destroy mankind with armies of the undead.
''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' played on television in relative obscurity until 1980, when authors Harry and Michael Medved dubbed the film the "worst movie ever made" in their book ''The Golden Turkey Awards''. Wood and his film were posthumously given two Golden Turkey Awards for Worst Director Ever and Worst Film.
At the funeral of an Old Man's wife, mourners are gathered by an open grave, among them her husband (Bela Lugosi). Overhead, an airliner is heading toward Burbank, California. The pilot Jeff Trent (Gregory Walcott) and his co-pilot Danny (David De Mering) are blinded by a bright light and loud sound. They look outside and see a flying saucer. The pilots follow the saucer's flight until it lands at the graveyard, where the funeral's gravediggers are killed by a female zombie (Maila Nurmi).
At his home, lost in his thoughts of grief, the Old Man goes outside and (offscreen) steps in front of an oncoming car and is killed. Mourners at the Old Man's funeral later discover the dead gravediggers. Inspector Daniel Clay (Tor Johnson) and other police officers arrive, but Clay goes off alone to continue his investigation.
Jeff Trent and his wife Paula (Mona McKinnon), who live near the graveyard, hear the sirens, and Jeff tells Paula about his saucer encounter, stating that the Army has since sworn him to secrecy. A powerful swooshing noise then knocks everyone to the ground at both the Trent residence and the nearby graveyard as a saucer lands. Police Inspector Clay then encounters the female zombie and the reanimated corpse of the Old Man, and he is killed by them.
Newspaper headlines continue to report saucer sightings over Hollywood Boulevard, while a trio of saucers flies over Los Angeles. In Washington, D.C. the military fire missiles at more saucers, while the Chief of Saucer Operations, Col. Thomas Edwards (Tom Keene), reveals that the government has been covering up saucer attacks. He mentions that one small town was annihilated, hinting at a secret history of other encounters.
The aliens return to their Space Station 7. Commander Eros (Dudley Manlove) informs their Ruler (John Breckinridge) that he has been unsuccessful in contacting Earth's governments. To force their acknowledgment, Eros recommends implementing "Plan 9", which will resurrect recently human dead by stimulating their pituitary and pineal glands. Meanwhile, Trent, about to leave on another flight, is concerned for his wife's safety. He urges her to stay with her mother, but she insists on staying home. That night, the zombie Old Man rises and breaks into their house. He pursues Paula outside and is joined by his zombie wife and the zombie Inspector Clay. Paula barely escapes, but then collapses after her ordeal. All three zombies then return to Eros' saucer.
At the Pentagon, Gen. Roberts (Lyle Talbot) informs Edwards that the government has been receiving alien messages. They explain that the aliens are trying to prevent humanity from eventually destroying the universe. The general dispatches Edwards to San Fernando, California, where most of the alien activity has occurred.
Though the Undead are under alien control, zombie Clay suddenly attacks and nearly strangles Eros. The Ruler closely examines zombie Clay and then orders the zombie Old Man destroyed in order to further frighten humanity. He then approves Eros' Plan 9 to raise Undead armies and orders they march on the capitals of Earth.
In California the police and Edwards interview the Trents. Unknown to them, the flying saucer has returned to the graveyard. Officer Kelton (Paul Marco) encounters the zombie Old Man, who then chases him into the Trents' yard, where the zombie Old Man is hit with Eros' ray, causing his body to rapidly decompose. Not knowing what to make of this, the Trents, Edwards, and the police drive to the cemetery.
John Harper (Duke Moore) insists on leaving Paula in the car, but Paula refuses to stay alone. As a concession, Kelton stays behind. Eros and fellow alien Tanna (Joanna Lee) send zombie Clay to kidnap Paula and lure the other three to their saucer. Seeing the saucer's glow off in the distance, Trent and the police head in that direction. At the car, Kelton is knocked out by zombie Clay. Upon awakening, Kelton calls for help, and Patrolman Larry (Carl Anthony) comes to his aid.
Eros allows Trent and the police to enter with their guns drawn. He then tells them human weapons development will inevitably lead to the discovery of "Solaronite", a substance that has the effect of exploding "sunlight molecules". Such an explosion would set off an uncontrollable chain reaction, destroying the ''entire'' universe. Eros now believes humans are too immature and stupid, so he intends to destroy mankind. Eros threatens to kill Paula if Trent and the police try to force him to go with them. Officers Kelton and Larry arrive, spotting zombie Clay holding the unconscious Paula not far from the saucer. Realizing their weapons are useless, they sneak up behind Clay and club him with a length of wood, knocking him out. Eros sees this and says Clay's controlling ray has been shut off, which allows Paula to go free. A fight then breaks out between Eros and Jeff, but the saucer's equipment is damaged during the struggle, starting a fire aboard. The humans quickly escape, and Tanna and the unconscious Eros fly away in their now burning saucer, which finally explodes, killing them both; their zombies quickly decompose to just skeletal remains inside their clothing.

The film combines elements of science fiction, Atompunk, and gothic horror. Science fiction remained popular throughout the 1950s, though the genre had experienced significant changes in the post-war period. The Atomic Age, heralded by the development of nuclear weapons and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had inspired science fiction films which were dealing with the dangers of unrestricted science while spaceflight and the existence of extraterrestrial life and civilizations, more "traditional" elements of the genre, seemed to hold new fascination for audiences experiencing the start of the Space Race. On the other hand, Gothic fiction had enjoyed the height of its popularity in film during the 1930s and 1940s. It was experiencing a decline in the 1950s and was seen as old-fashioned. The combination of dated and modern elements, by 1950s standards, gives the film a rather anachronistic quality.Craig 2009, pp. 138-177.
The film script seems to aim at making this an epic film, a "genre" which typically requires a big budget provided by a major film studio. That Ed Wood filmed the story with minimal financial resources underlines one of the qualities of his work: His ideas tended to be too expensive to actually put on film, and yet the director attempted them anyway. As Rob Craig argues, Wood's failed attempts result in the peculiar charm of the film to audiences. Craig finds that the film has much in common with both epic theatre ("grand melodrama on a minuscule budget") and the Theatre of the Absurd (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense and verbosity in dialogue, Dream art|dream-like and fantasy imagery, hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where continuity is consistently undermined).
The film opens with an introduction by Wood's friend, psychic Criswell: "Greetings my friends! We are all interested in the future, For that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives! ...". (This line appears in the narration for the General Motors' "Futurama" ride and its accompanying film, ''To New Horizons'', that were part of the 1939 New York World's Fair-years before Criswell's own television program.) At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP|KCOP-13) television series, ''Criswell Predicts''.The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show, but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction ''"Future events such as these will affect you in the future''", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.
Another line asserts that the audience is interested in "the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable", probably assuming that the film's audience will have a fascination with the paranormal. The narrator at some point starts claiming that "we" (the filmmakers) are bringing to light the full story and evidence of fateful events, based on the "secret testimony" of the survivors. The lines seem to emulate the style of sensational headlines in newspapers, and promise the audiences access to "lurid secrets" as if following the example of ''True Confessions'' and other similar magazines. The notion that a film or show could be based on true incidents and testimony would be familiar to a 1950s audience, because it was used in contemporary police procedurals such as ''Dragnet''.
Changing the tone, the narrator delivers the sermon-like lines: "Let us punish the guilty! Let us reward the innocent!" Which again sound as if a preacher addresses his audience. The introduction concludes with the dramatic question: "Can your heart stand the shocking facts about graverobbers from outer space?" The latter phrase was simply the original title of the film, but the rest of the line seems again to emulate the sensationalist press.
Through Trent's initial conversation with his wife, the film introduces the notion of a government and military conspiracy to cover up information on documented UFO sightings. This notion was clearly influenced by the emergence and increased popularity of a UFO conspiracy theory. The implications concerning the public's distrust of the government were atypical for a 1950s American film. Anti-statism|Anti-statist ideas were to become more popular in the 1960s, which is when the subject became "safe" for mainstream cinema.
The film contains a cautionary message from the aliens. The earliest use of this concept in film was probably in ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' (1951), and it had since seen frequent use in science fiction films. The idea was that the self-destructive behavior of humanity was the real threat, not any external source of danger.
The "iconic" flying saucer of the film has been variously identified as a paper plate or a hubcap. According to the documentary ''Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion'' (1991) it was actually a recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg Line model kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: "a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top." Inside the plastic dome was a little green man. Both a regular version of the assembled model and a modified version appear in the film.
The footage of Los Angeles is used to ground the otherworldly events to a realistic setting. As a resident, Wood was probably familiar with the locations. The scene where the military fires at the flying saucers is real military stock footage.
The Reverend Lynn Lemon, who plays an unnamed minister, was one of the Baptists variously involved in the production of the film. J. Edward Reynolds was a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention in Beverly Hills, California, and Hugh Thomas was one of his associates from the church; both play gravediggers, while Reynolds was also the producer of the film. At the time of the film's creation, David De Mering was the personal secretary and alleged lover of fellow cast member Bunny Breckinridge; his inclusion in the cast was probably a result of this association.
According to Maila Nurmi, she was recruited by Paul Marco to act as a vampire in the film. She was offered $200 for her part. She recalled insisting for her part to be silent, as she did not like the dialogue that Wood had scripted for her. This recollection might be inaccurate since the undead of this film are generally mute. What she contributed to the film was a "regal presence" and theatrical mannerisms. Her performance is reminiscent of a silent film actress; she credited Theda Bara as her main influence for the part.
The male alien Eros is apparently named after Eros, Greek god of love. Craig suggests that the name of the female alien, Tanna, might invoke the name of another Greek deity: Thanatos, god of death.

, in silent footage for the abandoned ''Tomb of the Vampire'', which was later recycled for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.
Shortly before Lugosi's death in August 1956, he had been working with Wood on numerous half-realized projects, variously titled ''Tomb of the Vampire'' or ''The Ghoul Goes West''.Peary 1981, pp. 266-270. Scenes unconnected to ''Plan 9'', featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking in and out of the side door of the Johnson home at nighttime, and a daylight scene on a patch of scrub land near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs seems to suggest that the director had something like ''Plan 9'' in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the ''Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West'' theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about ''Ghoul'' being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.
Shortly after Lugosi's death the story and screenplay for ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' were written and finalized, with Wood planning to use the unconnected, unrelated footage of Lugosi as a means of putting a credit for him on the picture. Wood used the Lugosi footage as a means of attracting actors to the picture, gaining the interest of Gregory Walcott and Maila Nurmi among others, by saying to them that he was making "Bela Lugosi's last movie" - what actor would not want to appear alongside a Hollywood legend in his swansong? Though Wood's actions were driven in part by the desire to give his film a 'star name' and attract horror fans, the Lugosi cameo was also meant as a loving tribute and farewell to the actor, who had become fast friends with Wood in the last three years of Lugosi's life. Wood hired his wife's chiropractor, Tom Mason, as a stand-in for Lugosi, even though Mason was taller than Lugosi and bore no resemblance to him, making him one of the earliest "fake Shemps". Narration from Criswell was also employed in an attempt to better link Lugosi's footage with the rest of ''Plan 9''. Every last scrap of material Wood had of Lugosi was utilized in the theatrical cut of the film, including what are minor sprocket discolorations, film trims that would in a normal film be discarded as unusable. Cuts of the film on VHS during the 80s and 90s, the vast majority unauthorized bootleg dupes, varied drastically not only in quality but also in the amount of Lugosi material retained.
Coincidentally, further Lugosi footage Wood had shot at an unspecified pre-1956 date was to have been the basis of a second posthumous movie for the horror legend, titled ''Ghouls of the Moon''. The footage had, however, been shot on volatile nitrate stock, and had dissolved into toxic-smelling sludge by the time Wood's thoughts turned to the new venture in the summer of 1959. ''Ghouls of the Moon'' was abandoned entirely as a result. Mystery surrounds the content and nature of the lost material, described only as 'wild' by a friend of Wood's who had seen the raw footage shortly after it was shot.
''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' was shot in November 1956, and had a private preview screening on March 15, 1957 at the Carlton Theatre in Los Angeles (the onscreen title at this time was ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''). Another year elapsed before Distributors Corporation of America (DCA) picked it up and copyrighted it, intending to distribute it during the spring of 1958, but the company folded and the film was not released until July 22, 1959 through Valiant Pictures, the receiver of DCA. By then the film had been re-titled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''. The original title gives the film the feel of a story from a pulp magazine. One story concerning the renaming is that the film's financiers, two local Baptist ministers, objected to the "Grave Robbers" part of the title. They reportedly considered the direct reference to grave robbery to be sacrilegious in nature, so Wood changed the title to "Plan 9". The original title is mentioned at the end of Criswell's opening narration when he asks the audience, "Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?"  It is also possible Wood didn't want to notify his backers that the film was finally being distributed, since by 1959, the backers may have completely given up on their hopes of getting a return on their investment. The new title is less indicative of the content and might have itself contributed to distribution problems for the film. Like many independent films of the period, ''Plan 9'' was distributed under a Film distribution#Pre-studio era|states' rights basis.

In Chicago it was first seen in January 1959, alongside the British thriller ''Time Lock'' (1957), a film which is mostly remembered as an early film credit for Sean Connery. Later that year, it was used as a "co-feature" (B movie) for double-feature screenings of ''The Trap'' (1959), a film noir with Richard Widmark as its star.

Viewers who have seen ''Plan 9'' in theaters or on television have often laughed at the random mistakes that are seen in the film, including visible microphones, ordinary chairs doubling for aircraft equipment, and plumbing hardware visible aboard the aliens' flying saucer, blaming it on Ed Wood for such careless staging. However, Wood framed his shots for the widescreen format, expecting that the ephemera at the top and bottom of the screen would be cropped in projection. Only when the film is viewed in its original widescreen format does it become apparent that Wood ''did'' compose his scenes correctly, and that the various objects intruding on the picture were never meant to be seen by the audience. Recent DVD releases of ''Plan 9'' restore the image to its proper dimensions, in a manner consistent with the director's original intentions. 
Critics say the absurdity of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' is found in the dialogue rather than on-screen action. Criswell's opening narration redundantly informs the viewer that "future events such as these will affect you in the future", while referring to viewers as "my friends" four times in the same minute. Criswell also begins the narration by referring to future events, only to later describe them in the past tense ("... the full story of what happened on that fateful day"), and inexplicably calling for "the guilty" to be punished.
Several exterior sets on sound-stages are interspersed with second-unit footage shot outdoors (for example, the old man's reanimated corpse chasing Paula Trent through the cemetery). In a number of these scenes the outdoor footage was intended to be shot Day for night|day-for-night, but this is not apparent in video transfers of the film, making these scenes contrast harshly against the on-set footage. Additionally, the military soldiers' hats are slightly lopsided, the "cemetery" and graves are obviously made out of HDF wood, and the leader of the aliens wears a generic stage play "medieval soldier" uniform.
During the first aircraft cockpit scene, the first officer is visibly reading from the script in his lap, and a flash of light from a flying saucer reveals the shadow of the boom microphone. The microphone and first officer's script are not visible in the film's original theatrical release, as they do not fit in the frame in its intended projection aspect ratio of 1.85:1."Plan 9 from Outer Space."

The music for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' was compiled by Gordon Zahler.

'''''Days of Darkness'''''  is a 2007 American horror film written and directed by Jake Kennedy.  Survivors of a zombie apocalypse, including a young couple played by Travis Brorsen and Roshelle Pattison, seek shelter in an abandoned military complex while they attempt to figure out what has caused the outbreak.
After a comet passes near the earth, most of the population becomes cannibalistic zombies.  Survivors gather at a military complex, where they discover that an alien parasite borne of the comet infects the zombies.  The group includes Trent, a preacher, and his infected brother, Herbert; Simon, a gay man; Steve and Mimi, a young couple; Chad, a man who has been bitten on the arm; an ex-porn star and her daughter; a rancher; and several soldiers.  As the infection worsens, the parasite causes men's genitals to fall off and virgin births among the females.  After an unsuccessful attempt to forage for supplies that results in the deaths of several people, Steve attempts to save Mimi from the infection.  As he anesthetizes her with alcohol prior to operating on her, the alien organism flees from her body.  Realizing that alcohol can save them, they become drunk and use the rancher's whiskey supplies to destroy the zombies.

The location, a decommissioned NORAD microwave station in Topanga, California, was purchased by a friend of the director.  Once they had the location, the filmmakers came up with a story; the producers desired a zombie film.
''Days of Darkness'' premiered at the 2007 Visionfest.
Brian Collins of Bloody Disgusting rated it 2/5 stars and called it "a zombie movie borne out of a drunken improv class".  Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic Peter Dendle said, "A few strange twists and some decent acting keep this humble Californian apocalypse on its feet."

'''''Rise of the Zombies''''', also known as '''''Dead Walking''''', is a 2012 American zombie horror film from The Asylum and directed by Nick Lyon.
A water-borne virus has led to a widespread outbreak of zombies in San Francisco. A group of survivors, including Dr. Lynn Snyder (Mariel Hemingway) and others, create a refuge on Alcatraz Island. Snyder receives communications from Dr. Arnold (French Stewart), a scientist conducting experiments to create a cure for the virus. Meanwhile, Dr. Dan Halpern (LeVar Burton), another of the refugees, is studying parts culled from the bodies of the zombies, but he is unable to make much headway because he only has access to 'dead' zombies. His research is further hindered when Caspian (Danny Trejo) and other refugees burn the zombie corpses being stored on the island.
A horde of zombies are washed onto the island by the tides, causing panic in the camp. While they are defeated, many of the refugees are killed, and two are infected by the virus, one of them being Halpern's daughter, Julie (Kerisse Hutchinson). The survivors decide to set out for the mainland, while Halpern stays to study the two infected victims. Later in the film, Halpern is forced to kill himself by detonating a grenade when his daughter bites him, before the virus can claim him as well.
The group on the mainland splits in two because of conflicting goals. Snyder wishes to find Dr. Arnold, as she believes he has found a cure, while Caspian's group instead wants to find supplies and ultimately reach what they believe to be an evacuation point. Caspian and several others are soon infected, and the group's numbers dwindle. It is eventually revealed that the 'evacuation point' has already been overrun by the zombies, rendering escape seemingly impossible.
As the group siphones gas from a car, Ashley commits suicide on a trolly by rolling it down the street colliding with a bus.
The last survivors of the group - Snyder, Kyle (Chad Lindberg) and Marshall (Ethan Suplee) - discover Dr. Arnold's refuge, the water treatment plant where the outbreak began. Arnold reveals that he has indeed discovered a cure, based on his tests on animal subjects. As the five flee for a chopper on the roof of the plant, both Kyle and Marshall are attacked, but Arnold's vaccine saves them. The group escapes the city, and Arnold requests a laboratory to manufacture his cure, expressing optimism that anything is possible.

''New York Daily News'' compared the film to ''The Walking Dead'', offering that it was more bloody and grisly, and that in comparison, ''Rise of the Zombies'' "makes ''Walking Dead'' look like ''Dora the Explorer''."  They also noted the film's "remarkably accomplished cast", and of the script wrote "their lines aren't Shakespeare, but they fall into the spirit, at least until most of them get chopped in half, eaten alive or whatever."  Mike Hale of ''The New York Times'' felt that the film was "largely in the venerable horror tradition of movie-as-extended-chase-scene" and that ''The Walking Dead'' was "gentle by comparison."  They wrote that the film had "credible action sequences" and that the script offered " tiny flashes of wit".

'''''Decay''''' is a 2012 horror film by Luke Thompson (of the University of Manchester), set at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.
Thompson, a physics doctoral student, came up with the idea of the film while he was walking through the maintenance tunnels at CERN and began thinking that it would be a good location for a horror movie. In an interview with ''Wired'', he stated that the film was initially started for fun, but that it was also an opportunity to "do some satirical commentary on various aspects of people's perceptions of science".
A security guard is walking along the maintenance tunnel of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN when he turns around, meets a man (face is not shown) whom he recognizes, and  informs him that he is not supposed to be down there. The man proceeds to shoot the guard dead.
Connor and James are roommates and were at a party the previous night. Amy is James's sister; she and Matt come over to Connor's and James's apartment to pick them up for work. All four of them are physicists at CERN working on the Large Hadron Collider. James works with the LHC, while the others analyze the data generated by it. They are on their way to attend an emergency meeting at CERN. They have no idea why the meeting was called, but Amy believes it can't be very important. At CERN, they overhear Dr. Niven and the Director General arguing over safety. Dr. Niven wants the LHC to be stopped till he can assess the safety, but the Director General overrides his concerns and informs him that, once the problem is fixed, the LHC would work normally and finding the Higgs boson is of utmost importance. The Director General realizes that Connor, James and Amy are listening to them and he asks the security guard to shut the door.
At the conference room they meet Lisa, who was supposed to be in Barcelona for a conference but missed her flight due to the party. The Director General addresses the attendees and informs them that the previous night there was a beam dump in LHC. The beam dump occurred because the beam sensors had detected that the monopole magnet at LHC segment 11G had quenched due to an unknown event, which triggered the LHC to shut down. He further warns that, if the event occurs again, there could be a catastrophic accident at CERN. Dr. Niven is selected to take a team of technicians down to the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause of the incident and try to get the LHC running again. The Director General requests four volunteers to be in the control room while Dr. Niven is busy. Connor volunteers for the task and the Director General selects Connor, James, Amy and Lisa. Lisa bails out, informing the Director General that she has to attend a conference in Barcelona, so Matt is selected instead.
Amy is working on a task assigned to her by Dr. Niven, which involves simulating the impact of Higgs boson radiation on human tissues. The simulation fails because of some parameters, Dr. Niven proposes changes and requests Amy to try again. James introduces his girlfriend Kate to Connor, Amy and Matt. Kate works as a trainee nurse and joins them in the control room. Amy's simulation is crashing after the changes proposed by Dr. Niven. Connor proposes running the simulation on the mainframe computer instead of her laptop and grants her access to start the simulation on the mainframe. As Amy runs the simulation on the mainframe, the LHC beam monitor indicates that the LHC is up and running. James checks the system and realizes that the system has turned on by itself and Amy had nothing to do with it.
The team led by Dr. Niven is still in the maintenance tunnel of the LHC and they are at risk of being exposed to radiation. James and Connor try to shut down the LHC, but they are unsuccessful; the emergency shutdown switch is not working. The radiation alarm goes off and they decide to run away to avoid being exposed to the radiation. The elevator near the control room is not working and there is no mobile signal since they are over hundred meter underground. They decide to go down to the maintenance tunnel and James manually shuts down the LHC. Connor informs the group that the LHC cannot be turned on from the control room and neither do they have access rights to turn on the LHC. Since the LHC is now off, they can use the elevator in the maintenance tunnel to get out; they believe that the team led by Dr. Niven is dead due to radiation.
As they walk through the maintenance tunnel, they are attacked by the technicians of the team led by Dr. Niven and Kate is captured. Connor, Amy, James and Matt lock themselves up in a room and James uses the coolant to scare away the technicians. Amy and Connor realize that the technicians had radiation burn marks on their skin and cannot comprehend how the technicians are still alive. Connor finds another way out of the room and they head back into the maintenance tunnel, where they find the dead body of the security guard killed at the beginning of the movie. They find the interlock array and see that it has been destroyed, which indicates sabotage. They are again attacked by the technicians, so they decide to find a mainframe to contact somebody for help. On their way, they are attacked again and this time James is bitten.
They finally find the mainframe server room, James wants to check if Kate is still alive. Amy and Connor work on the mainframe consoles to breach the firewall to ask for help, but are unsuccessful. Finally, the results of Amy's simulations come up; they indicate that the boson radiation has the capability to destroy human brain. This makes them realize that the technicians are all dead and have become zombie like. Amy and James head back into the maintenance tunnel, where they find the Director General's security guard is dead. James recovers a gun from the guard. Finally, they find Kate's dead body, which the zombies have mutilated. Meanwhile, Connor is studying the simulation data when somebody triggers a deletion of the results. Amy and James return to the mainframe server room, where Connor informs them that only the Director General has the rights to delete the data.
James and Connor manage to unlock all the doors using the mainframe console. Finally, James succumbs to his injury and turns into a zombie, attacking the others. Matt bolts, leaving Connor and Amy to defend themselves. Connor shoots James. Amy and Connor go back to the maintenance tunnel and are attacked by the zombies. Connor is bitten and Amy shoots him when he turns. Zombies escape the maintenance tunnel through the unlocked doors and attack people outside. Amy is chased by zombies, but she manages to elude them. Matt is attacked and eaten alive by the zombies.
Amy manages to reach the surface and is chased by the zombies. She goes to Dr. Niven's office to collect data about his simulation to collect evidence against the Director General. She calls up Lisa on her mobile to inform her that the Director General is responsible for the deaths at CERN, but she is redirected to her voice mail. The Director General enters Dr. Niven's office, picks up the gun left behind by Amy and points it at her. Amy manages to get a confession out of the Director General; as he is about to pull the trigger it is shown that Amy had not disconnected the call and that the confession has gone to Lisa's voice mail. The screen goes black and the sound of a gunshot is heard.

Thompson began filming in 2010 and took two years to complete ''Decay'', with the film's crew having to borrow cameras and create special effects on a limited budget. CERN gave permission for ''Decay'' to be filmed at the research center with the stipulation that they not film in any of the facility's more sensitive areas.
A film trailer was released in the autumn of 2012, with some sites such as Fearnet commenting that while the film did not look particularly good, the premise of ''Decay'' was an interesting one.
Decay was released on 8 December 2012  for download and streaming via YouTube and Vimeo.

'''''Pet Sematary Two''''' is a 1992 horror film directed by Mary Lambert. The screenplay was written by Richard Outten.  It is the sequel to the 1989 film ''Pet Sematary''. The film stars Edward Furlong, Anthony Edwards and Clancy Brown.
Following the accidental death of his mother Renee during production of her latest film, thirteen-year-old Jeff Matthews and his veterinarian father Chase move to the town of Ludlow, Maine. Jeff learns about the Creed family, and about the cursed Indian burial ground.
His friend Drew's dog, Zowie, is fatally shot by Gus Gilbert - Drew's stepfather, who also happens to be the town sheriff - for chasing Gus's pet rabbits. Complicating matters is the fact that Gus was in love with Renee 20 years ago; ever since she turned him down to marry Chase, Gus has been venting his ire on everything and everybody around him. 
Jeff and Drew bury Zowie at the Indian cemetery, in order to bring the dog back to life. It works, with some side effects: Zowie is uncharacteristically fierce, and the dog's eyes have an unnatural glow to them, even in daylight. Gus grounds Drew for skipping school to bury Zowie (despite Gus demanding that he do so). Chase treats Zowie for his gunshot wound, which refuses to heal; even more bizarre is the fact that Zowie has no heartbeat. Chase sends a sample of Zowie's blood to a lab. It turns out that Zowie's cells have completely deteriorated and are no different from those of a dead canine. 
Jeff goes to the pet cemetery on Halloween for a night of horror stories, notably about the Creed murders. The still-grounded Drew goes along on his mom's orders; she wants to get even with Gus for repeatedly and unfavorably comparing her to Renee. Gus comes to the cemetery looking for Drew. He beats up his stepson after chasing off all the other kids except  Jeff, who is swatted away like a fly when he tries to stop Gus's bullying. Gus rips up a gravemarker and is about to hit Drew with it when Zowie appears and fatally mauls Gus, whom the boys subsequently bury at the Indian cemetery. Gus returns to life; he now moves stiffly and rarely speaks, but does treat his wife and stepson better. Gus becomes increasingly crude and sadistic, sexually assaulting Drew's mother and brutally skinning his pet rabbits for supper.
Zowie breaks out of the veterinary clinic and kills three cats, before entering Chase's home and attacking him, injuring his arm. A day later, Jeff encounters school bully Clyde Parker - who is about to sever Jeff's nose using the wheel-spokes of his own motorcycle when Gus shows up. He sends Jeff home, then murders Clyde as Drew looks on. 
Gus traps Drew inside their house with the savage Zowie. Drew escapes through a window just as his mother arrives home. Gus's police car chases them down the highway; he finally kills them both, by forcing their car into a collision with a truck. Afterward, Gus drags Clyde's body off to the cursed burial ground.
That night, Jeff decides to reanimate his mother by using the Indian burial ground`s power. Gus exhumes her corpse, and brings it to Jeff at the burial ground. When Chase hears that his wife's grave has been robbed by Gus, he rushes to the Gilbert house. There he is attacked by Zowie, and then by Gus, wielding an electric drill. Chase shoots and kills them both. 
Upon coming back to life, Renee stabs and kills Marjorie Hargrove - the Matthews' housekeeper. Jeff confronts his undead mother in the attic and they embrace. Chase arrives home and urges Jeff to get away from Renee, who says she wants to spend quality time with her husband. An undead Clyde arrives and tries to kill Jeff; first with an ax, and then with an ice-skate. Renee locks Chase and both boys in the house, which she then sets on fire.
Jeff kills Clyde with a severed insulated cable, then breaks down the attic door to reach his father. Renee wants Jeff to stay and join her in death, saying she loves him, but Jeff drags his father out of the house as Renee is destroyed by the flames.
Jeff and Chase leave Ludlow for Los Angeles.

'''''Killing Spree''''' is a 1987 horror film written and directed by Tim Ritter.  Its plot follows a man who becomes jealous of the imagined affairs of his wife and kills everyone she meets, only for them to come back as zombies.
Tom Russo, a paranoid airplane mechanic struggling to make ends meet, becomes convinced his wife, Leeza, is cheating on him with various men after he finds and reads what he assumes is Leeza's diary. While Leeza is out grocery shopping one afternoon, Tom's friend Ben (who Tom suspects is one of the men Leeza is having an affair with) drops by with his girlfriend Angel. Tom decapitates Angel, beats Ben to death with her head, and buries the couple's remains.
The next day, Tom lures back an electrician who he believes had sex with Leeza and scalps him by lifting the man into a ceiling fan that has had machetes attached to the blades. Tom sends Leeza to her mother's house and kills three others (a TV repairman, a courier, and a gardener) she wrote about sleeping with. The death of the courier is witnessed by Mrs. Palmer, the neighborhood busybody, so Tom rips her mandible out with a claw hammer.
At the offices of ''Romping Romance Magazine'', Leeza shows her "diary" off, and reveals the adulterous anecdotes in it are just works of fiction. Leeza returns home to show Tom the cheque she received for her stories, just as Tom's victims return as zombies to avenge their own deaths. The ghouls initially want Tom, but offer to spare him if he kills Leeza (who they conclude is the one truly responsible for what happened to them). Tom refuses this bargain, and commits suicide by slitting his own throat with a hacksaw. The zombies deem this turn of events acceptable, exit the house, and leap into a pit that appears in the backyard. Leeza tries to leave as well, but as soon she opens the front door, she is attacked by an undead Tom.

'''''Doomsday Book''''' (
It won the top prize at the 2012 Fantasia Festival. The jury honored it with the Cheval Noir Award for best film for "its intelligence and originality."
''Doomsday Book'' was originally conceived as a three-part anthology film to be directed by Kim Jee-woon, Yim Pil-sung, and Han Jae-rim. Filming began on May 21, 2006, but shortly after Kim and Yim had shot their segments, financing fell apart and the film was put on hold. Han's third segment titled "The Christmas Gift" (a SF musical retelling of O. Henry's short story, about a woman's primal desires emerging when confronted with her last chance to survive after witnessing the end of the world) was never shot, and the two thirds remained unreleased.
But in 2010 with backing from new investor TimeStory, shooting restarted quietly with Yim and Kim collaborating on a new third installment to the trilogy with Yim as the lead director and Kim in more of a "guest director" role.
It was pre-sold to six countries at the Berlin International Film Festival#European Film Market|Berlin Film Market and screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

'''''Dead & Buried''''' is a 1981 science fiction horror film directed by Gary Sherman, starring Melody Anderson, Jack Albertson, and James Farentino. The film focuses on a small town wherein a few tourists are murdered, but their corpses begin to reanimate. With a screenplay written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, the movie was initially banned as a "video nasty" in the UK in the early 1980s, but was later acquitted of obscenity charges and removed from the Director of Public Prosecutions' list.
While the film made less money at the box office, it has received praise from critics regarding Stan Winston's special effects and Albertson's role. In addition to the film being subsequently novelized by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, the film has obtained a cult following in the years since its release.
James Farentino stars as Dan Gillis, sheriff of the small New England coastal town of Potter's Bluff. In the film's opening scene, a mob of townspeople attempt to kill a visiting photographer. He is beaten, tied to a post then set on fire.  He survives and is taken to a hospital, where he is murdered just out of sight of the sheriff and the doctor.
More visitors are murdered by the townspeople. Sheriff Gillis, assisted by Dobbs, the local coroner-mortician (Jack Albertson), works hard to discover the motive for the killings. Gillis becomes increasingly disconcerted as a grisly death occurs every day.  In each case, the killers photograph the victims as they are murdered.
Gillis accidentally hits someone with his squad car following an attack. On the grill of his car, Gillis finds the twitching severed arm of the accident victim, who attacks him and flees with the arm. After the attack, Gillis scrapes some flesh from the vehicle and takes it to the local doctor, who tells him that the tissue sample has been dead approximately four months. Gillis grows suspicious of Dobbs and conducts a background check.  He discovers that Dobbs was formerly the chief pathologist in Providence, Rhode Island, until he was dismissed 10 years before for conducting unauthorized autopsies in the county morgue.
At the climax, it is revealed that Dobbs has developed a secret technique for reanimating the dead, and all of the townspeople are reanimated corpses under his control. Dobbs considers himself an "artist" who uses his zombies to murder the living in order to create more corpses on which to practice his reanimation technique. The Sheriff is unaware that he is also one of the living dead, having been murdered some time ago by his undead wife under Dobbs' orders.  Gillis notices his hands decomposing, and Dobbs asks to examine them.

In a 1983 interview with ''Starburst'' promoting ''Blue Thunder'', O'Bannon disowned the film, claiming that Shusett had actually written it by himself but needed O'Bannon's name on the project, promising he would implement some of O'Bannon's changes. Upon seeing the finished film, O'Bannon realised that Shusett hadn't included his material, but it was too late for him to take his name off the credits.
The opening shot depicting the central street scene in Potters Bluff was filmed along Lansing Street in Mendocino, California.
Rotten Tomatoes reports that 73% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 11 reviews.
''Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For'' author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that ''Dead & Buried'' "is another fine homage to the EC Comics style of horror, with a story that also echoes the structure of a classic Rod Serling ''Twilight Zone'' episode," adding that the film is "a late-night treat that works best with the lights off and no foreknowledge of what's to come."

'''''Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead''''' is a 2006 black comedy musical-horror film from Troma Entertainment, directed by Lloyd Kaufman and co-directed by former long-time Troma editor Gabriel Friedman from a screenplay by Friedman and Daniel Bova. The film opened to positive reviews from ''Entertainment Weekly'' and ''The New York Times''. ''Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead'' was released in 2006 in theaters and in 2008 on DVD.
''Poultrygeist'' follows a group of consumers and ordinary citizens who are trapped inside a New Jersey fried chicken fast food restaurant - the American Chicken Bunker - which is being attacked by a chicken-possessed zombie demonic alien spirit because the building is erected on top of a sacred Native American burial ground. The protagonist is Arbie (Jason Yachanin), an ACB employee trying to win back the heart of his ex-girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham), an activist protesting against the restaurant, who has left Arbie for another woman.
High school sweethearts Arbie and Wendy meet the day before Wendy's departure to college to consummate their relationship in the Tromahawk Indigenous peoples of the Americas burial ground, promising to each other that no matter what happens, they will always stay faithful to each other. She is grossed out after finding a man jacking off to their lovemaking, but he's later killed by zombie hands spouting from the ground which tear through his system and out of his mouth, grabbing Arbie's underwear that he was masturbating with. One college semester later, when Arbie returns to the spot of his one and only sexual encounter, he is shocked to discover two unsettling realities: not only has the burial ground been bulldozed and replaced by an American Chicken Bunker, a mega-conglomerate fast food franchise, but college has turned his dear Wendy into a "Left-wing politics|leftist, lipstick lesbo liberal", protesting the construction of the fried chicken menace with her activist girlfriend Micki (Allyson Sereboff).
Disillusioned and out for revenge, Arbie decides to get a job at the American Chicken Bunker. Under the supervision of paranoid manager Denny, Arbie is thrust into the monotony of minimum wage with a variety of colorful co-workers: the effeminate Mexican Paco Bell (Khalid Rivera), the Bestiality|animal-loving redneck Carl Jr. (Caleb Emerson), the burqa-clad Muslim Hummus (Rose Ghavami) and a mysterious 60-year-old man in the restaurant's basement who has worked as the restaurant's costumed mascot all his life and has a virtually identical background to Arbie.
However, strange things are afoot at the American Chicken Bunker. While grinding meat, Paco is pushed into the meat grinder by an uncooked chicken. General Lee Roy decides not to do anything, and lets Paco get turned into sloppy jose. Arbie begins to unravel a sinister plot involving the spirits of disenfranchised Native Americans and the billions of slaughtered chickens sent to the "concentration coops" who plan on exacting their revenge in the most gruesome ways possible, after being told so by Paco (who is reanimated as a sloppy jose). Carl Jr, who is having intercourse with an uncooked chicken in the storage room, fights the uncooked chicken when it starts biting his penis. Hummus manages to kill the uncooked chicken by shoving a broom up Carl's backside, though it tears off his penis. General Lee Roy tells them not to take him to a hospital.  He instead tells them to give the chicken (which has been sprayed with blood and green ichor) to the protester outside. Carl Jr. is killed when Arbie gives him alcohol to drink. After Mickie tells the protesters that the chicken tastes good, the protesters go inside the restaurant to eat chicken. Wendy finds out that Mickie has been paid by General Lee Roy to say that the chicken tastes good; she breaks up with Mickie and returns to Arbie. General Lee Roy gets diarrhea after being force-fed eating a piece of chicken. General Lee Roy lays an egg in the bathroom and is attacked by the chicken that hatches from the egg. He rips off the chicken's head with his teeth and is sprayed with green blood.  He becomes a giant egg and hatches into a chicken zombie. He then decapitates Denny (who is telling a story about the first time he encountered a chicken).
The customers, workers, and protesters then all turn into zombie chickens. The mascot (Lloyd Kaufman) shoots all the chicken zombies inside with an M-16 machine gun.  The General Lee Roy zombie returns, but is shot down by the mascot.  As the old man approaches the General, he gets his nose ripped off by a now zombie chicken Denny. Arbie then shoots and kills Denny. Wendy turns the open/closed sign to "closed", which keeps the chicken zombies at bay. The mascot, who is still alive, tells Arbie that he is his future self. He then turns into a chicken zombie. Mickie, who attempts to escape, is turned into a zombie chicken. She and the Mascot chicken zombie chase after Arbie and Wendy. Hummus drinks meat steroid in an attempt to save them and accidentally kills herself in the process. Arbie and Wendy realize that beer kills the chicken zombies and then kill the Mickie and mascot zombie. They run out of beer and are saved by Hummus (who is still alive, despite having exploded a few minutes earlier). They find a child hiding in the storage room and are attacked once again by the General Lee Roy chicken. It is then killed by the Paco sandwich. Hummus is then shown to have C-4 strapped to her body and tells them that she will sacrifice herself. Wendy, Arbie, and the little girl escape as the building explodes. While being driven home in a car, the child experiences stomach cramps after drinking a soda and eventually starts clucking like a chicken thus laying an egg, frightening her, Arbie, and Wendy. The guys eventually lose control and crash, resulting in the car back-flipping before landing on the ground and exploding, thus killing all inside.
In a post-credits scene, the zombified chickens are shown dancing as a reprise of the ''Poultrygeist'' theme song plays.

Taking six years from script to screen, ''Poultrygeist'' was officially released on DVD in 2008 following a limited theatrical run.
''Poultrygeist'' first began as a spec script of the same title submitted to Troma Entertainment by Daniel Bova around 2002. After a number of re-writes at the hands of several Troma employees, the script reached a final draft in 2004, completed by long-time Troma editor Gabriel Friedman. Then given the title ''Poultrygeist: Attack of the Chicken Zombies'', Troma heavily promoted the film in the mid-2000s in an attempt to gain funding, though ultimately failed to secure adequate financing.
 is on the far left.
The budget for ''Poultrygeist'' was roughly around $500,000, a typical budget for a Troma film. A large part of the film's financing came out-of-pocket from Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, while Kaufman and his wife, Patricia Swinney Kaufman, dipped into their personal retirement savings to help fund the film.
Much of ''Poultrygeist'' Duggie Banas, who composed the movie's musical numbers, became attached to the film after answering an online ad looking for composers who'd be willing to work on a film for free.Lloyd Kaufman & Gabriel Friedman. ''Poultrygeist'' DVD audio commentary. Many of the props and masks featured in the film were donations from special effects studios from around the world.
Shot on 35 mm film by long-time Troma cinematographer Brendan C. Flynt, principal photography for ''Poultrygeist'' took place during the summer of 2005 at an abandoned McDonald's in the Bailey-Kensington neighborhood of Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, New York. Over 80 crew members and 300 unpaid extras worked on the film. A nearby abandoned church was rented out by Troma, where over 70 cast and crew members resided for the duration of the shoot, despite only housing one working bathroom.
As chronicled in ''Poultrygeist''s making-of documentary ''Poultry in Motion: Truth Is Stranger Than Chicken'', the production was plagued with numerous problems, including malfunctioning special effects, delayed and over-scheduled filming, pay disputes with the actors and even the restaurant set being prematurely deconstructed on the last day of shooting. Despite the production hardships, ''Poultrygeist'' managed to successfully complete its principal photography by August 2005.
.
Press coverage of ''Poultrygeist'' began even in the earliest stages of the film's production. British publication Hotdog Magazine covered the film in 2005 while filming was still in progress, while Ain't It Cool News, ''Attack of the Show'' and ''Fangoria'' reported on the film throughout the stages of its post-production, with the latter giving ''Poultrygeist'' a full four-page feature in mid-2007.
''Poultrygeist'' received some media attention when Troma picketed the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival held at Manhattan
''Poultrygeist'' grossed $22,623.http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=poultrygeist.htm The film made its first premiere at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film on April 14, 2007, and spent the remainder of 2007 playing international engagements in Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, Spain, and film festivals including the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival and the Calgary International Film Festival. The film began playing throughout the United States in early 2008, making its official cast and crew-attended premiere in New York City on May 9, 2008.
''Poultrygeist'' played in New York through July 3, followed by two-week long run at the Laemmle Sunset in Los Angeles on June 14.
The film continued to make sporadic theatrical engagements throughout the United States up to and even after its official DVD release. On April 17, 2009, ''Poultrygeist'' had a wide release in the Midwest, opening simultaneously in 11 theaters in eight states, including two screens each in Wisconsin and Indiana.
The film has a certified "fresh" rating of 64% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the general critical consensus being that it "may be relentlessly tasteless and juvenile, but it's also a lively slice of schlocky fun".
Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' awarded the film a B+ rating, calling it "an exploitation movie with soul" and noting "it's genuine sick fun, and there isn't a boring moment in it".
On the negative end of the critical spectrum, Roger Moore of the ''Orlando Sentinel'' felt the film "wears out its joke, like all Troma films, long before that last 50-gallon keg of fake blood is tapped...it's a 40-minute short struggling to escape a 103-minute feature", giving it a rating of two out of five stars.
In contrast to Kaufman's previous films, ''Terror Firmer'' and ''Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV'', which heavily referenced and relied on the audience's familiarity of Troma films, ''Poultrygeist'' is only loosely connected with the "Tromaverse" yet makes numerous background references to their previous films. Arbie can be seen wearing an "I Love the Monster Hero" shirt from ''The Toxic Avenger'' in an early scene, posters of ''Tromeo and Juliet'' and ''When Nature Calls'' adorn the walls of Wendy's bedroom, and DVD copies of ''Tales from the Crapper'' can be seen stuffed in a dumpster. Most notably, ''Poultrygeist'' features the infamous car flip stunt that was originally filmed in 1991 for ''Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.'' and has been recycled for comic effect in every Kaufman-directed film since.
The soundtrack album for ''Poultrygeist'' was released on October 3, 2006, through Troma Entertainment, featuring the film's musical segments composed by Duggie Banas, snippets of film dialogue and a selection of punk rock songs from bands including The Dwarves, Zombina and the Skeletones, Scatterbox and Potshot. All copies of the soundtrack came with a bonus DVD featuring numerous special features including trailers and the first five minutes of the movie.
''Poultrygeist'' received its DVD release on October 28, 2008, in an "Eggs-clusive 3-Disc Collector's Edition", which featured the following bonus material:
* ''Poultry in Motion: Truth is Stranger than Chicken'' - a feature-length (82 minutes) behind-the-scenes documentary on the production of ''Poultrygeist'', directed by the film's producer Andy Deemer and line producer Jason Foulke.
* Deleted scenes, including an alternate ending with Ron Jeremy.
* Audio commentary from Lloyd Kaufman and Gabriel Friedman.
* Footage of ''Poultrygeist'''s NYC premiere.
* Seven behind-the-scenes featurettes, including "Recording the Songs", "Designing the Monsters", "Filming the Meat Grinder" and "Joe Fleishaker Gets a Head Mold".
The third disc was a "Kara-Yolk-E" supplement, featuring all of the film's musical numbers with an optional karaoke track added on.
On March 31, 2009, a two-disc "Special Egg-Dition" was released, omitting the karaoke disc. On February 23, 2010, the film was issued on Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray.
''Poultrygeist'' made national news on January 7, 2011, when Sidney Klawitter from Orland, California, purchased a DVD cleaning kit from a local retailer, only to later discover the cleaner disc was a disguised copy of the film ''Poultrygeist''. Klawitter was deeply offended by the film's content, noting "it was horrifying", calling it "a X rating|Triple-X rated movie".  According to the owner of the store the cleaner kit was purchased from, the item had come pre-packaged from a warehouse distributor in Oakland, California. No charges were filed.

'''''Dead Meat''''' is a 2004 Irish zombie film written and directed by Conor McMahon, starring Spanish theatre actress Marian Araujo and veteran Irish actor Eoin Whelan.
A mutated strain of mad cow disease infects the Irish countryside, turning people into ravenous, flesh-eating zombies. Caught amid this chaos are a young Spanish tourist and the local gravedigger. Together, this unlikely duo must fight for survival or become part of the Zombie Fest.
The gravedigger is also furnished with a deadly shovel, presumably used for digging graves and/or slaying zombies, dragons, other mythological creatures and evil bacon.

Dan Ewing, of Australian soap opera ''Home and Away'' had an extra role as a castle zombie.
''Dead Meat'' was filmed in and around the village of Leitrim, County Leitrim|Leitrim, County Leitrim, Ireland.
According to the "making of..." featurette included in the US DVD release, the film was greenlighted under a new funding scheme from the Irish Film Board called "Microbudget Films", targeted at frugal independent filmmakers.  ''Dead Meat'' was the first microbudget film to receive a release.  To cut costs, the crew used many donated sets, filmmakers' personal vehicles and recruited volunteer extras at the local pub. Dead Meat received video distribution by Revolver Entertainment in the UK and ''Fangoria'' Entertainment in the US.
David Muyllaert, who played heroic gravedigger Desmond in ''Dead Meat'', also sang lead on the film's title song, the punk-metal-ish "Dead Meat".
Dennis Harvey of ''Variety'' wrote, "A rural Irish setting and mad cow disease plot hook do surprisingly little to distinguish fast-moving but routine zombie flick".

'''''Porn of the Dead''''' is a 2006 pornographic horror film written and directed by Rob Rotten.
''Porn of the Dead'' has no overarching plot or storyline; instead it consists of five unconnected sequences which depict people having sex with the undead in a world which appears to be experiencing the onset of a zombie plague.
The film begins with a man finding a dazed, emaciated, and filth-encrusted woman in a waitress's uniform stumbling down a road. The man forces the woman into his car, and takes her to a house, where he strangles her in a pit full of plastic, newspapers, and body parts. The killer leaves to get a protective suit and an axe, and when he returns he finds nothing but the woman's discarded clothing in the hole. As the man scours pit in confusion, the now undead woman reappears, and attacks him, ripping off his gear, and performing fellatio on him. The man and the zombie have rough sex, which ends when the zombie bites the man's penis off, resulting in her being "facialized" by blood.
A girl is then shown in her bedroom, masturbating with a toy while fantasizing about being intimate with a male zombie. The girl and the zombie have sex, and the daydream concludes when the girl has an orgasm in real life. Out in the woods, a group of people are in the middle of filming a porno, when three naked male zombies crash the set. The cast and crew members are either killed (one has his heart ripped out and eaten in front of him) or scared off, leaving the female star of the film to be gangbanged by the ghouls. In a morgue, an employee places a female body on a table, and begins molesting it. The corpse eventually reanimates as a zombie, which the attendant has sex with. 
At a psychiatric hospital, an orderly enters a room covered in drawings of Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses, and discovers the female resident lying on the floor, having seemingly killed herself via self-induced head trauma. The orderly removes the patient's straitjacket, and decides to have sex with the body before alerting anyone about the suicide. The girl returns to life as a zombie mid-coitus, and bites one of the orderly's fingertips off, angering him, and prompting him to get rough. After the orderly ejaculates, the zombie rips his innards out with her teeth, and gnaws on them as the man expires.

''Porn of the Dead's'' DVD release was delayed due to the main distributor, Metro Interactive, being uncomfortable about some of the film's content, which resulted in it being re-edited. Writer and director Rob Rotten was not displeased by this turn of events, giving the official statement, "I think it's a good compromise between me and Metro. I'm really happy with the finished product" to Adult Video News.  
 
AVN gave the film a four out of five, and wrote "It's visually arresting, with effective theatrical lighting and visual effects added to age and distress the look of it. The original metalcore soundtrack rocks, and the makeup is quite effective. The fucking is hot in that it's highly energetic and angry, but the zombies and humans fucking while covered in blood and gore isn't exactly pretty. There's a humor and seriousness to it that walk hand in hand."  
An overall score of two was awarded by XCritic, which stated "''Porn of the Dead'' is an interesting experiment that, while not completely successful, is definitely worth a look for the curious out there. Nice cinematography, a cast of reasonably attractive girls and a decent 'making of' documentary add to the package."  
Something Awful gave the film a -45, opening with "Dark sets and over-adjusted contrast conceal silly special effects and the cast of uniformly unappealing actresses and actors. There is no overarching plot, just a series of plodding vignettes and vague (often inappropriate) set pieces for zombies and people to fuck each other. The soundtrack is a grinding black metal run-on sentence of garbled screaming that mirrors the erotic effects of running your teeth down a chalkboard". The website concluded its review with "There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It is too murky to function as pornography, too fake to function as a horror movie and it has a repulsive theme sure to send shockwaves through the Bible Belt and prompt vague 'crackdowns' on obscenity. The women are all either ugly or made up so that you can't tell if they are attractive. ''Porn of the Dead'' is just one big unappealing mess."

'''''Evil Head''''' is a 2012 American pornographic horror film written and directed by Doug Sakmann,  
For their vacation, Ash, his wife List of The Evil Dead characters#Linda|Linda, their friend List of The Evil Dead characters#Scotty|Scotty, and his wife List of The Evil Dead characters#Shelly|Shelly travel to an apparently abandoned woodland cabin, where they find a recorder, audio reels, and an old book. Scotty plays one of the reels, which were made by the cabin's owners, List of The Evil Dead characters#Professor Raymond Knowby|Professor Raymond Knowby, and his wife, List of The Evil Dead characters#Henrietta Knowby|Henrietta. The reel reveals that the professor and his wife were working on translating the book, a seemingly demonic sex guide known as the ''Necronomicum Ex-Mortis''. While reciting a mantra that he found in the ''Necronomicum'', Knowby seemingly went insane, laughing maniacally as he repeated the words over and over again, awakening an evil force.
The group ignores the reel, and while Shelly goes to lie down, Ash, Linda, and Scotty have a threesome in a bedroom. Shelly walks in on the trio and, distraught over Scotty's infidelity, runs out into the forest, where she is violated by possessed trees that turn her into a "Deadite". Shelly returns to the cabin, knocks Ash out, and stabs Linda with a piece of bark that she pulls out of her vagina, infecting the other woman with the evil. Shelly proceeds to seduce Scotty, have sex with him, and rip his throat and testicles out.
When Shelly tries to attack Linda, Ash fends her off with a fireplace poker, and locks her in the cellar, but she escapes, and begins having sex with the now demonic Linda. Aroused by the sight of the two Deadites going at it, Ash tries fingering Shelly, which results in his hand becoming possessed. Ash is forced to cut his hand off with a chainsaw, which he then uses to kill Shelly by forcing her to "ride" the tool's blade.
Linda, who has returned to normal, confronts Ash with a locket identical to the one that he had earlier given her. Inside the locket is a picture of Ash having sex with another woman, which angers Linda to the point of causing her to turn back into a Deadite. Ash and Linda wind up having sex; afterward, Ash beheads Linda with the chainsaw, and takes her body out into the woods to dispose of it. Linda's still-living severed head taunts Ash, annoying him into masturbating onto it out of spite.
Ash returns to the cabin, and goes into hysterics when the furniture and fixtures (including a mounted deer head) go haywire. Outside, Linda (who has reattached her head) rises from the grave, along with Deadite versions of two of Ash's ex-girlfriends. Ash tries to kill the Deadites with the chainsaw (which he has replaced his missing hand with) but it will not start, leaving him unable to fight off the demonesses as they force him into an orgy. The reverse gangbang ends with Ash using the now functional chainsaw to dismember the undead women as he quips, "Groovy!"

Ain't It Cool News responded positively to the film, noting that it was "a humorous homage" and that "the story bits, what little there are, are pretty entertaining" before concluding, "Sure, there will be those who will turn their noses up to ''Evil Head'', but in this wide world of horror, surely there is room for the porn horror subgenre; especially in this case when it apes the original so well". Peter Warren of ''AVN'' gave ''Evil Head'' a perfect score of 5, finding it to be "every bit the rollicking rollercoaster ride of gleeful grotesquery one could hope for" and "without question one of the most outstanding productions to ever come out of Burning Angel".  
A grade of 3/5 was given to ''Evil Head'' by Inked Angels, which opined, "The sex parts are just mediocre. Burning Angel has released a lot hotter and better material than this before".

'''''13 Eerie''''' is a 2013 Canadian horror film directed by Lowell Dean, making his feature film debut. It is also produced by Don Carmody, Kevin DeWalt, Mark Montague and David Cormican and written by Christian Piers Betley. The film stars Katharine Isabelle, Michael Shanks, Brendan Fehr, Brendan Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jesse Moss. It entails the story about six forensic undergrads completing a university field exam on a deserted island, oblivious that the island was previously used for illegal biological experiments on life-term prisoners.
Six forensic undergrads, Megan (Katharine Isabelle), Daniel (Brendan Fehr), Josh (Brendan Fletcher), Patrick (Jesse Moss), Kate (Kristie Patterson) and Rob (Michael Eisner), are assigned to complete a scientific field exam on a deserted island known as Eerie Strait, where life-term prisoners were once held and corpses lay dead. With cameras set up, Professor Tomkins (Michael Shanks) dispatches them into pairs to examine corpses in different areas as part of staged murders, restricting the pairs from interacting, only allowing their use of walkie talkies to report back to him. Unfortunately these have been accidentally damaged. He also monitors their activities from a surveillance cabin.
Shortly, Larry (Nick Moran), an ex-con who transported the group, warns partners, Megan and Kate, about finding the unexpected corpse of a skinhead female in a jumpsuit which soon comes alive in their working area. Rob spots the zombie in the woods and tries to warn his partner, Daniel, who dismisses it. Due to the earlier damage, all of the walkie talkies lose battery life, and communication is broken. While in the woods alone, the zombie pursues Kate and cannibalizes parts of her. Josh and Patrick hear her screams and see a figure's movements in the woods, suspecting there is a problem.
As Larry tries to inform an initially skeptical Tomkins, who is upset with Larry for inadvertently destroying much of the equipment, Megan finds Kate injured, carrying her back to the student cabin before she dies. Rob, believing something is up, leaves Daniel to go out on his own. As Kate revives as a zombie and Rob approaches her as one after being bitten to death by the tattoo zombie (Ryland Alexander) and thug zombie (Jason Truong), Megan is forced to gruesomely kill the two of them. The remaining crew splits up and searches for the missing others, and Daniel finds Megan. Back at the main cabin, as the zombies attack, Tomkins shoots the skinhead zombie that is outside and inside where Larry botches a molotov cocktail, the thug zombie is able to pull Larry underneath the cabin to bite him to death.
Tomkins tells Megan and Daniel to hide in a school bus. Chased by the zombies, Josh and Patrick seek safety in a prison bus, honking the horn that alerts the others to their location. Leaving the school bus, Megan and Daniel see zombie Larry coming after them. Megan accidentally fires a shot that injures Daniel, but she shoots Larry dead. They are found and they join Josh and Patrick on the prison bus. The zombies attack the bus, and they crash the tattoo zombie into a nearby cabin, resulting in Patrick's death. The thug zombie comes after them and it is shot down. They drive away, but the bus starts to smoke and it tips over a branch and crashes, though Megan, Daniel and Josh, who sustains a knee injury, all survive. Not long after, the tattoo zombie catches up to them and Megan shoots it, but runs out of bullets. As she is about to be bitten, Josh saves her, driving an arrow through the zombie's head.
The next day Tomkins finds them. Captain Veneziano (Lyndon Bray) drives by and they have him pull over. Megan, Daniel and Josh get into the car as Tomkins attacks Veneziano, who is pressured to admit the island was used for conducting biological experiments on prisoners sentenced to death row and turned into a death camp when the testing went wrong years ago. The tattoo zombie approaches from behind and Tomkins sacrifices Veneziano to save his own life. He attempts to drive off with his students, only to realize the keys are clenched between the teeth of the zombie. The final scene shows Megan, Daniel, Josh and Tomkins looking terrified about their fates.

'''''Shivers''''' (aka '''''The Parasite Murders''''', '''''They Came from Within''''', and '''''Frissons''''' for the French-Canadian distribution) is a 1975 Canadian science fiction body horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg. The original shooting title was ''Orgy of the Blood Parasites''.
Dr. Emil Hobbes is conducting unorthodox experiments with parasites for use in transplants. He believes that humanity has become over-rational and lost contact with its flesh and its instincts, so the effects of the alien organism he actually develops is a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease. Once implanted, it causes uncontrollable sexual desire in the host.
Hobbes implants the parasites in his teen-aged mistress, who promiscuously spreads them throughout the ultra-modern apartment building outside Montreal where they live. Hobbes, unable to undo the damage he caused, kills his mistress and then commits suicide. The police are called and the crime looks to be open and shut.
As the story develops, one of Hobbes' sexual partners begins to feel ill and returns from work. Here we see the parasite emerge from its host and escape into the building where it emerges and attacks a number of people. The pace of the story quickens when the community's resident physician, Roger St. Luc, uncovers some of the research that Hobbes had been working on. St. Luc encounters an elderly resident who has been attacked and burned by the parasite. St. Luc, along with his assistant and girlfriend, Nurse Forsythe, move the elderly residents to their room. They attempt to stop the parasite infestation before it overwhelms the city's population.
Instructing the elderly couple to wait and lock themselves in, St. Luc continues to the basement where the residents told him they had disposed of the parasite. St. Luc is attacked by a caretaker but manages to defeat him by bashing in his skull. Forsythe leaves the safety of the elderly residents' room and continues after St. Luc, where she is attacked, but is rescued by St. Luc. Meanwhile, upstairs it is clear that the parasite has spread the infection as more and more of the residents start to act out. The scene closes with the elderly couple's apartment broken into by the infected. Downstairs the security guard is infected and the auctioneer showing the apartment is slowly entrapping other unsuspecting guests.
St. Luc escapes to the parking garage where Forsythe is attacked by an infected resident. St. Luc rescues her and takes her to his car. However, as they attempt to crash through the gate to the parking garage another car rams them. St. Luc helps Forsythe free and they escape to a remote area in the building. At this stage Forsythe starts to act out, showing that she too has become infected. St. Luc is forced to leave her and forge on to escape but at every turn he is trapped. Eventually he finds himself trapped in the swimming pool and he is attacked and eventually infected by Forsythe.
The closing scene is the residents happily exiting the residential block in their cars. The viewer is left to believe that Hobbes' plan to infect the world is underway.

The film's chaotic structure mirrors the collapse of residential life in the apartment block. The opening shows a young couple being welcomed as residents to the tower block, intercut with Dr Hobbes murdering his adolescent mistress by strangling her, then cutting open her stomach and pouring acid into her body to kill the parasites, and then cutting his own throat. Partway into the story, the audience learn the reason for Hobbes's actions; most of ''Shivers'' consists of social set piece tableaux showing the sexual promiscuity that spreads the parasites to the other residents. Cronenberg said he identified with the residents ''after'' they were infected; and shows the swinging sterility of "normal" life mercilessly caricatured through the characterization of the bland, rich, young professionals inhabiting the apartment block, and the hard-sell estate agent's sales pitch from Merrick, which accompanies the opening titles.
''Shivers'' was Cronenberg's first feature film, and was the most profitable Canadian film made to date in 1975, but was so controversial that the Canadian parliament debated its social and artistic value and effect upon society, because of objections to its sexual and violent content.
''Shivers'' was released in Montréal on October 10, 1975 where it was distributed by Cinépix. The film was released in Canada as ''The Parasite Murders'' and in both Canada and the United Kingdom as ''Shivers''. The film was released in the United States as ''They Came From Within''.
The film was released on DVD by Image Entertainment on September 16, 1998 and is currently out of print.
On its initial release, ''Shivers'' was not a positively received film.
Canadian journalist Robert Fulford, writing as "Marshall Delaney", decried the content of ''Shivers'' in the pages of the national magazine ''Saturday Night''. Since Cronenberg's film was partially financed by the taxpayer-funded Canadian Film Development Corporation (later known as Telefilm Canada), Fulford headlined the article "You Should Know How Bad This Movie Is, You Paid For It." He called it "crammed with blood, violence and depraved sex" and "the most repulsive movie I've ever seen."

'''''Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer''''' is a 2012 American independent horror comedy feature film directed by Zack Beins and Richard Taylor, and written by Beins, Taylor and Tim Johnson.
Atom (Mark Shonsey) is an avid Bowler (ten-pin)|bowler and hardcore horror movie fan. After having his team barred from the championship due to bowling alley corruption and losing his horny girlfriend Emily (Lindy Starr) to sadistic rival bowler Dario (Zachary Byron Helm), Atom suffers a severe head injury, causing him to hallucinate that everyone around him are the flesh-eating undead. Believing the zombie apocalypse has arrived, Atom must defend himself from the "zombies" in the most violent and unpredictable manner possible.
''Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer'' has been described as a "love letter to Troma", featuring much of the campy aesthetic and graphic violence and nudity common of the company's films, as well as including many overt references to Troma movies and a cameo appearance from Troma president Lloyd Kaufman.
''Atom'' is the first feature-length film from Denver, Colorado-based production company Bizjack Flemco and filmmakers Zack Beins and Richard Taylor, who had previously directed the 2007 short film ''The Misled Romance of Cannibal Girl & Incest Boy'' and had provided special effects work for several independent films, most notably Troma Entertainment To help finance the film, Beins and Taylor shot a fake trailer to generate interest, and hosted several benefit concerts for the movie with local bands.
The film was shot entirely in the cities of Denver and Arvada, Colorado|Arvada, Colorado over the course of four years. According to interviews with Taylor and Beins, the production was troubled by numerous issues, exacerbated by the extremely low budget of the film; notably, large portions of the film had to be re-shot after one of the main actors quit and had to be recast, while problems in finding affordable filming locations resulted in shooting at five different bowling alleys. ''Atom'' was shot in high-definition video; as neither Beins or Taylor owned an HD camera, the two tracked down a friend who did and offered him an acting role in exchange for use of their camera.
In addition to Troma president Lloyd Kaufman, the cast of ''Atom'' also includes cameo appearances from Denver performance artist Maris the Great, KBPI DJs Uncle Nasty and Matt Need, paranormal claims investigators Bryan & Baxter, internet personality Shawn C. Phillips and popular drag queen horror actor Babette Bombshell (''Not Another B Movie'', ''Class of Nuke 'Em High#Sequels|Return to the Class of Nuke 'Em High''). Zachory Byon Helm, who was cast as the film's primary antagonist Dario, is the president of the , and several of his hearses were used in the production.
''Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer'' made its premiere at the Denver Starfest convention on April 20, 2012 and continued to play at independent film festivals across the Midwest, including the TromaDance Film Festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the  and the Fort Collins Horror Film Festival, as well as select screenings in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. In 2013, the film was screened at the Denver Comic Con, followed by a Los Angeles premiere at the California Institute of Abnormalarts. The same year, ''Atom'' was again screened in Denver with ''Midget Zombie Takeover'' by ''The Worst Movie Ever!'' director Glenn Berggoetz.
A DVD release of the film is scheduled after the film completes its film festival run. According to Taylor and Beins, Troma may release it should the filmmakers not find a better distribution deal. In November 2012, Bizjack Flemco independently released a limited run of fifty VHS copies of the film in a clamshell box.
In 2013 at Comic-Con International Taylor and Beins sat on the panel for Troma Entertainment and were asked by a fan if the film will be released on something more current then VHS. Taylor asks Lloyd Kaufman if Troma would release a DVD of the film. Kaufman replies "Will see how it does on VHS." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AotnnIr4XfI 
The movie's eponymous theme song was written and recorded by the Orange County, California|Orange County comedy punk band The Radioactive Chicken Heads.
A digital soundtrack album for the film, featuring both the original score done by Tim Johnson and songs from punk, rock and metal bands, was released on the online music store Bandcamp on May 10, 2012. In 2012, another music video was produced and made for the song "Rock & Bowl" which features all the producers of Atom under the persona band Bolonium.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnu_b987Fg
On May 28th 2014 it was announced that the film will be released on DVD officially by Whacked Movies early 2015. The Special Edition DVD was released on August 25th 2015.

'''''Night of the Living Dead''''' is a 1968 American independent horror film, directed by George A. Romero, starring Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea. It was completed on a $114,000 budget and premiered October 1, 1968. The film became a financial success, grossing $12 million domestically and $18 million internationally. It has been a cult classic ever since. ''Night of the Living Dead'' was heavily criticized at its release for its explicit gore. It eventually garnered critical acclaim and has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry, as a film deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
The story follows characters Ben (Jones), Barbra (O'Dea), and five others trapped in a rural farmhouse in Western Pennsylvania, which is attacked by a large and growing group of unnamed "living dead" monsters drawing on earlier depictions in popular culture of the ghoul, which has led this type of creature to be referred to most popularly as a zombie. This is the most easily recognized version of the living dead, to the point where people gather in mass quantities for conventions dressed as zombies, complete with makeup and prosthetic limbs. ''Night of the Living Dead'' led to  five subsequent films between 1978 and 2010, also directed by Romero, and inspired two remakes; the most well-known remake was released in 1990, directed by Tom Savini.
Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner) drive to rural Pennsylvania for an annual visit to their father's grave. Barbra is attacked by a strange man (Bill Hinzman) walking in the cemetery. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but the man throws him against a gravestone; Johnny strikes his head on the stone and is killed. After a mishap with the car, Barbara escapes on foot, with the stranger in pursuit, and later arrives at a farmhouse, where she discovers a woman's mangled corpse. Fleeing from the house, she is confronted by strange menacing figures like the man in the graveyard. Ben (Duane Jones) takes her into the house, driving the "monsters" away and sealing the doors and windows.  Throughout the night, Barbra slowly descends into a stupor of shock and insanity.
Ben and Barbra are unaware that the farmhouse has a cellar, housing an angry married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman), along with their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon). They sought refuge after a group of the same monsters overturned their car. Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), a teenage couple, arrived after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal murders.  Karen has fallen seriously ill after being bitten by one of the monsters.  They ventured upstairs when Ben turns on a radio, while Barbra awakens from her stupor. Harry demands that everyone hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a "deathtrap" and continues upstairs, to barricade the house with Tom's help.
Radio reports explain that a wave of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern United States. Ben finds a television, and they watch an emergency broadcaster (Charles Craig) report that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming the flesh of the living. Experts, scientists, and the United States military fail to discover the cause, though one scientist suspects radioactive contamination from a space probe. It returned from Venus, and was deliberately exploded in the Earth's atmosphere when the radiation was detected.
Ben plans to obtain medical care for Karen when the reports listed local rescue centers offering refuge and safety. Ben and Tom refuel Ben's truck while Harry hurls molotov cocktails from an upper window at the ghouls. Judy follows him, fearing Tom's safety. Tom accidentally spills gasoline on the truck setting it ablaze. Tom and Judy try to drive the truck away from the pump, but Judy is unable to free herself from its door, and the truck explodes, killing them both; the zombies promptly eat the charred remains.
Ben returns to the house, but is locked out by Harry. Eventually forcing his way back in, Ben beats Harry, angered by his cowardice, while the zombies feed on the remains of Tom and Judy. A news report reveals that, only a gunshot or heavy blow to the head can stop them, aside from setting the "reactivated bodies" on fire. It also reported that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.
The lights go out moments later, and the zombies break through the barricades. Harry grabs Ben's rifle and threatens to shoot him. In the chaos the two fight and Ben manages to wrestle the gun away and shoots Harry. Harry stumbles into the cellar and collapses next to Karen, mortally wounded. She has also died from her illness. The ghouls try to pull Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself. She returns to the refuge of the cellar to see Karen is reanimated and eating Harry's corpse. Helen is frozen in shock, and Karen stabs her to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the zombies, is carried away by the horde and devoured. As the zombies overrun the house, Ben seals himself inside the cellar, where Harry and Helen are reanimating, and he is forced to shoot them.
Ben is awakened by the posse's gunfire outside the next morning.  He ventures upstairs. A member of the posse mistakes him for one of the ghouls and shoots him through the forehead.  The film ends with a photo montage of Ben as his body is thrown into the posse's bonfire, laid next to the original zombie from the cemetery.

* Duane Jones as Ben: The lead role of Ben was played by Duane Jones. He was an unknown stage actor. His performance depicted Ben as a "comparatively calm and resourceful Negro" (a distinguished gentleman and former university professor, in real life), according to a movie reviewer in 1969.Kevin Thomas, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Los Angeles ''Times'', January 10, 1969, reprinted in ''The A-List: The National Society of Film Critics' 100 Essential Films'', ed. Jay Carr (Cambridge, Mass.: Da Capo Press, 2002), p. 199, ISBN 978-0-306-81096-1 . Casting Jones as the hero was potentially controversial, in 1968. It was not typical for a black man to be the hero of a U.S. film when the rest of the cast was composed of white actors at the time, but Romero said that Jones "simply gave the best audition".George A. Romero, quoted in Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror Movies'', p. 118. He was in a few other films after ''Night of the Living Dead''. He continued as a theater actor and director until his death in 1988. Despite his other film roles, Jones worried that people only recognized him as Ben.Duane Jones interview, Bonus Materials, ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition (DVD, Elite Entertainment, 2002).
* Judith O'Dea as Barbra: Judith O'Dea, a 23-year-old commercial and stage actress, once worked for Hardman and Eastman in Pittsburgh. O'Dea was in Hollywood seeking to enter the movie business at the time of audition. Starring in the film was a positive experience for her, she remarked in an interview. She admitted that horror movies terrified her, particularly Vincent Price's ''House of Wax'' (1953). Besides acting, O'Dea performed her own stunts, which she jokingly claimed amounted to "lots of running". "I honestly had no idea it would have such a lasting impact on our culture", assessing ''Night of the Living Dead''. She was just as surprised by the renown the film brought her: "People treat you differently. [I'm] ho-hum Judy O'Dea until they realize [I'm] Barbra from ''Night of the Living Dead''. All of a sudden [I'm] not so ho-hum anymore!"
* Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper
* Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper: Eastman also played a female ghoul eating an insect.
* Keith Wayne as Tom
* Judith Ridley as Judy: Judith Ridley later co-starred in Romero's ''There's Always Vanilla'' (1971).
* Kyra Schon as Karen Cooper: Hardman's 11-year-old daughter played Karen. Schon also played the woman's mangled corpse that Ben dragged away.
* Charles Craig as  Newscaster /zombie
* Bill Hinzman as Cemetery Living Dead: The cemetery living dead who kills Johnny in the first scene. Hinzman also appeared in new scenes that were filmed for the 30th-anniversary edition of the film.
* George Kosana as Sheriff McClelland: Kosana was credited as the film's production manager.
* Russell Streiner as Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner is also an Executive Producer in the 1990 remake of the film. He makes a cameo appearance as Sheriff McClelland.)
* Bill Cardille, a.k.a., "Chilly Billy Cardilly."  Cardille was well-known locally as a Pittsburgh TV man who had his own horror movie show, "Chiller Theatre," on TV late Saturday nights in the 1960s and '70s.  Bill portrays a WIIC-TV, Channel 11 (a real Pittsburgh TV station) news reporter. (Bill Cardille also makes a cameo appearance as the TV news reporter in the 1990 remake of the film)
Romero's friends and acquaintances were recruited as zombie extras. Romero stated, "We had a film company doing commercials and industrial films so there were a lot of people from the advertising game who all wanted to come out and be zombies, and a lot of them did." He adds, "Some people from around Evans City who just thought it was a goof came out to get caked in makeup and lumber around."George A. Romero interview, quoted at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. Romero himself had a cameo as a Washington reporter who asks questions about the zombie epidemic. The main characters watched the TV for news reports.
Romero embarked upon his career in the film industry while attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He directed and produced television commercials and industrial films for The Latent Image, in the 1960s, a company he co-founded with friends John A. Russo|John Russo, and Russell Streiner. The trio grew bored making commercials and wanted to film a horror movie during this period. They wanted to capitalize on the film industry's "thirst for the bizarre",Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. according to Romero. He and Streiner contacted Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, president and vice president respectively of a Pittsburgh-based industrial film firm called Hardman Associates, Inc. They pitched their idea for a then-untitled horror film. A production company, conceived by Romero, called Image Ten, was formed which included Romero, Russo, Streiner, Hardman and Eastman. The initial budget was $6,000 with the ten members of the production company, investing $600 each for a share of the profits. Another ten investors were found when it was found that another $6,000 was required but this was also soon found to be inadequate. Image Ten eventually raised approximately $114,000 for the budget.George A. Romero, Preface to John Russo, ''The Complete Night of the Living Dead Filmbook'' (Pittsburgh: Imagine, Inc., 1985), pp. 6-7, ISBN 978-0-911137-03-3 .
Co-written as a horror comedy by John Russo and George A. Romero under the title ''Monster Flick'', an early screenplay draft concerned the exploits of adolescent aliens who visit Earth and befriend human teenagers. A second version of the script featured a young man who runs away from home and discovers rotting human corpses that aliens use for food scattered across a meadow. Russo came up with the concept that they would be the recently dead only, because they could not afford to bring long-dead people out of their graves, or at least "we" thought. He also came up with the idea that they would be "flesh-eaters."  Romero decided he liked those two ideas and without them, it would have been labeled a true 'rip-off' of "Richard Matheson's I Am Legend" novel (1954).  The final draft, written mainly by Russo during three days in 1967, focused on reanimated human corpses - Romero refers to them as ''ghouls'' - that consume the flesh of the living.John A. Russo, ''The Complete Night of the Living Dead book'' (Pittsburgh: Imagine, Inc., 1985), ISBN 978-0-911137-03-3 , quoted in "Treatment/Original Script", Bonus Materials, ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition (DVD, Elite Entertainment, 2002), . In a 1997 interview with the BBC's ''Forbidden Weekend'', Romero explained that the script developed into a three-part short story. Part one became ''Night of the Living Dead''. Sequels ''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978) and ''Day of the Dead'' (1985) were adapted from the two remaining parts.George A. Romero interview, ''Forbidden Weekend'', BBC, February 2, 1997.
Romero drew inspiration from Richard Matheson's ''I Am Legend'' (1954), a horror fiction|horror/science fiction novel about a plague that ravages a futuristic Los Angeles. The infected in ''I Am Legend'' become vampire-like creatures and prey on the uninfected.Richard Matheson, ''I Am Legend'' (1954; New York: Orb Books, 1995), ISBN 978-0-312-86504-7 .Marco Lanzagorta, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition DVD, at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. Discussing the creation of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Romero remarked, "I had written a short story, which I basically had ripped off from a Richard Matheson novel called ''I Am Legend''.""One for the Fire: The Legacy of ''Night of the Living Dead''" - ''Night of the Living Dead'' DVD, 2008, Region 1, ''Dimension Home Entertainment'' Romero further explained:
Official film adaptations of Matheson's novel appeared in 1964 as ''The Last Man on Earth'', in 1971 as ''The Omega Man'', and the 2007 release ''I Am Legend''. Matheson was not impressed by Romero's interpretation, feeling that "It was ... kind of cornball",Richard Matheson interview, in Tom Weaver, ''Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1999), p. 307, ISBN 978-0-7864-0755-2. though he later said, "George Romero's a nice guy, though. I don't harbor any animosity toward him."Clark Collis, ''An Author You Can't Refuse'', , December 7, 2007. Critic Danél Griffin remarked, "Romero freely admits that his film was a direct rip-off of Matheson's novel; I would be a little less harsh in my description and say that Romero merely expanded the author's ideas with deviations so completely original that [''Night of the Living Dead''] is expelled from being labeled a true 'rip-off'". by Danél Griffin, ''Film as Art: Danél Griffin's Guide to Cinema''
Russo and Romero revised the screenplay while filming. Karl Hardman attributed the edits to lead actor Duane Jones:
Eastman modified cellar scenes featuring dialogue between Helen and Harry Cooper. According to lead actress Judith O'Dea, much of the dialogue was improvised. She told an interviewer, "I don't know if there was an actual working script! We would go over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each felt it ''should'' be done".Judith O'Dea interview, in Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 4. One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnny's death:
Although the film is regarded as one of the launching pads for the modern zombie movie, the screenplay itself never uses the word. In fact, Romero would later confess that he felt the film's antagonists were distinct enough from Haitian zombies that they were "something completely new" with Romero actively avoiding any similarities between the two creatures although he notes that he may have subtly been inspired by them.
The lead role was originally written for someone of Caucasian decent but upon casting Duane Jones, an African American actor to play him, Romero intentionally did not alter the script to reflect this. Asked in 2013, if he took inspiration from the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination|assassination of Martin Luther King Jr that same year, Romero responded in the negative noting that he only heard about the shooting when he was on his way to find distribution for the finished film.

The small budget dictated much of the production process. According to Hardman, "We knew that we could not raise enough money to shoot a film on a par with the classic horror films with which we had all grown up. The best that we could do was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot". Scenes were filmed near Evans City, Pennsylvania|Evans City, Pennsylvania, 
The outdoor, indoor (downstairs) and basement scenes were filmed at a location northeast of Evans City, near a park. The basement door (external view) shown in the film was cut into a wall by the production team and led nowhere. As this house was scheduled for demolition, damage during filming was permitted.

Props and special effects were fairly simple and limited by the budget. The blood, for example, was Bosco Chocolate Syrup drizzled over cast members' bodies."The Filming" of ''Night of the Living Dead'' at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. Consumed flesh consisted of roasted ham and entrails donated by one of the actors, who also owned a chain of butcher shops. Costumes consisted of second-hand clothing from cast members and Goodwill. Zombie makeup varied during the film. Initially makeup was limited to white skin with blackened eyes; but as filming progressed mortician's wax was used to simulate wounds and decaying flesh. As filming was not linear, the piebald faces appear sporadically. Eastman supervised the special effects, wardrobe and makeup.

''Night of the Living Dead'' was the first feature-length film directed by George A. Romero. His initial work involved filming shorts for Pittsburgh public broadcaster WQED's children's series ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''. Romero's decision to direct ''Night of the Living Dead'' essentially launched his career as a horror director. He took the helm of the sequels as well as ''Season of the Witch'' (1972), ''The Crazies'' (1973), ''Martin'' (1978), ''Creepshow'' (1982) and ''The Dark Half'' (1993).George A. Romero biography at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. Critics saw the influence of the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s in Romero's directorial style. Stephen Paul Miller, for instance, witnessed "a revival of fifties schlock shock... and the army general's television discussion of military operations in the film echoes the often inevitable calling-in of the army in fifties horror films". Miller admits that "''Night of the Living Dead'' takes greater relish in mocking these military operations through the general's pompous demeanor" and the government's inability to source the zombie epidemic or protect the citizenry.Stephen Paul Miller, ''The Seventies Now: Culture as Surveillance'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1999), p. 81, ISBN 978-0-8223-2166-8 . Romero describes the mood he wished to establish: "The film opens with a situation that has already disintegrated to a point of little hope, and it moves progressively toward absolute despair and ultimate tragedy".George A. Romero, quoted in Royer, ''The Spectacle Of Isolation'', p. 15. According to film historian Carl Royer, Romero "employs chiaroscuro (film noir style) lighting to emphasize humanity's nightmare alienation from itself".Carl Royer, ''The Spectacle of Isolation in Horror Films: Dark Parades'' Binghamton, N.Y.: Haworth Press, (2005), p. 15, ISBN 978-0-7890-2264-6 .
While some critics dismissed Romero's film because of the graphic scenes, writer R. H. W. Dillard claimed that the "open-eyed detailing" of taboo heightened the film's success. He asks, "What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother? And Karen, in the film, offers a particularly vivid opportunity to commit the forbidden deed vicariously".R. H. W. Dillard, "''Night of the Living Dead'': It's Not Like Just a Wind That's Passing Through", in ''American Horrors: Essays on the Modern American Horror Film'', ed. Gregory A. Waller (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988), p. 15, ISBN 978-0-252-01448-2 . Romero featured social taboos as key themes, particularly cannibalism. Although zombie cannibals were inspired by Matheson's ''I Am Legend'', film historian Robin Wood sees the flesh-eating scenes of ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a late-1960s critique of American capitalism. Wood asserts that the zombies represent capitalists, and "cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism". He argues that the zombies' victims symbolized the repression of "the Other" in bourgeois American society, namely activists in the Civil Rights Movement, Second-wave feminism|feminists, homosexuals, and counterculturalists in general.Robin Wood, "An Introduction to the American Horror Film", in ''Movies and Methods'', Vol. II, ed. Bill Nichols (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985), p. 213, ISBN 978-0-520-05409-7 .
Members of Image Ten were involved in filming and Film editing|post-production, participating in loading camera magazines, gaffing, constructing props, recording sounds and editing. Production stills were shot and printed by Karl Hardman, who stated in an interview that a "number of cast members formed a production line in the darkroom for developing, washing and drying of the prints as I made the exposures. As I recall, I shot over 1,250 pictures during the production". Upon completion of post-production, Image Ten found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. Columbia and American International Pictures declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot the final scene were rejected by producers.Jason Paul Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's: Interviews with 20 Cult Film Actresses'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 4, ISBN 978-0-7864-1818-3. Romero admitted that "none of us wanted to do that. We couldn't imagine a happy ending. . . . Everyone want[ed] a Hollywood ending, but we stuck to our guns".George A. Romero interview, quoted at "George A. Romero Bio", Special Features, ''Dawn of the Dead'', Special Divimax Edition (DVD, Anchor Bay, 2004), . The Manhattan-based Walter Reade Organization agreed to show the film uncensored, but changed the title from ''Night of the Flesh Eaters'' to ''Night of the Living Dead'' because a film had already been produced under a similar title to the former. While changing the title, the copyright notice was accidentally deleted from the early releases of the film.
Karl Hardman told an interviewer that the music came from the extensive film music library of WRS Studio. Much of what was used in the film was purchased from Hi-Q (production music)|Capitol Production Music, the production music library of Capitol Records, and an album of the soundtrack was released at one point. Stock music selections included works by WRS sound tech Richard Lococo, Philip Green, Geordie Hormel, Ib Glindemann, William Loose, John Seely, Jack Meakin and Spencer Moore.
The opening title music with the car on the road had been used in a 1961 episode of the TV series ''Ben Casey'' entitled "I Remember a Lemon Tree" (that piece of music accompanying each time that George C. Scott's character, a doctor who is secretly a drug addict, is injecting himself with morphine), and is also featured in an episode of ''Naked City (TV series)#Season 1: 1958.E2.80.9359|Naked City'' entitled "Bullets Cost Too Much". Most of the music in the film had previously been used on the soundtrack for the science-fiction B movie|B-movie ''Teenagers from Outer Space'' (1959). The eerie musical piece during the tense scene in the film where Ben finds the rifle in the closet inside the farmhouse as the radio reports of mayhem play in the background can be heard in longer and more complete form during the opening credits and the beginning of ''The Devil's Messenger'' (1961) starring Lon Chaney, Jr. Another piece, accompanying Barbra's flight from the cemetery zombie, was taken from the score for ''The Hideous Sun Demon'' (1959). According to WRS, "We chose a selection of music for each of the various scenes and then George made the final selections. We then took those selections and augmented them electronically". Sound tech R. Lococo's choices worked well, as Film historian Sumiko Higashi believes that the music "signifies the nature of events that await".Sumiko Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead'': A Horror Film about the Horrors of the Vietnam Era", in ''From Hanoi to Hollywood''
Sound effects were created by WRS Studio in Pittsburgh. "Sound engineer Richard Lococo recorded all of the live sound effects used in the film". Lococo recalled, "Of all the sound effects that we created, the one that still gives me goosebumps when I hear it, is Marilyn's screaming as [Helen Cooper] is killed by her daughter. Judy O'Dea's screaming is a close second. Both were looped in and out of echo over and over again".
A soundtrack album featuring music and dialogue cues from the film was compiled and released on LP by Varèse Sarabande in 1982; it has never been reissued on CD. In 2008, recording group 400 Lonely Things released the album ''Tonight of the Living Dead'', "an instrumental album composed entirely of ambient music and sound effects sampled from Romero's 1968 horror classic".Paul Corupe, "They're Coming to Remix You, Barbra", ''Rue Morgue'' (No. 92, August 2009), p. 63
In 2010, the record company Zero Day Releasing released the CD ''They Won't Stay Dead!: Music from the soundtrack of Night of the Living Dead''. It features all-new digitally restored audio from original library LPs and reels. Widely unknown David Ruch an aspiring musician helped extensively with the movies score however received no credit as many contributors did not promoting thought zombies alive and well beyond the theater...
''Night of the Living Dead'' premiered on October 1, 1968 at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh. Nationally, it was shown as a Saturday afternoon matinée - as was typical for horror films at the time - and attracted an audience consisting of Preadolescence|pre-teens and adolescents. The MPAA film rating system was not in place until November 1968, so even young children were not prohibited from purchasing tickets. Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film with such potent content for a horror film they were entirely unprepared for: "I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them," he said. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:
Response from ''Variety'' after the initial release reflects the outrage generated by Romero's film: "Until the Supreme Court establishes clear-cut guidelines for the pornography of violence, ''Night of the Living Dead'' will serve nicely as an outer-limit definition by example. In [a] mere 90 minutes this horror film (pun intended) casts serious aspersions on the integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers, distributor Walter Reade, the film industry as a whole and [exhibitors] who book [the picture], as well as raising doubts about the future of the regional cinema movement and about the moral health of film goers who cheerfully opt for this unrelieved orgy of sadism..."
One commentator asserts that the film garnered little attention from critics, "except to provoke argument about censoring its grisly scenes".Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 175.
Despite the controversy, five years after the premiere Paul McCullough of ''Take One'' observed that ''Night of the Living Dead'' was the "most profitable horror film ever [...] produced outside the walls of a major studio".Paul McCullough, "A Pittsburgh Horror Story", ''Take One'' 4 (No. 6, July-August 1973), p. 8. The film had earned between $12 and $15 million at the American box office after a decade. It was translated into more than 25 languages and released across Europe, Canada and Australia.

Reviewers disliked the film's gory special effects. ''Variety'' labeled ''Night of the Living Dead'' an "unrelieved orgy of sadism" and questioned the "integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers".''Variety'', review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', October 15, 1968, quoted in Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 184. ''The New York Times'' critic Vincent Canby referred to the film as a "junk movie" as well as "spare, uncluttered, but really silly".Vincent Canby, "Getting Beyond Myra and The Valley of the Junk", New York ''Times'', July 5, 1970, p. 49.
Some reviewers cited the film as groundbreaking. Pauline Kael called the film "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made - and when you leave the theatre you may wish you could forget the whole horrible experience. . . . The film's grainy, banal seriousness works for it - gives it a crude realism".Pauline Kael, ''5001 Nights at the Movies'' (Henry Holt and Company, 1991), ISBN 978-0-8050-1367-2 . A ''Film Daily'' critic commented, "This is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper."''Film Daily'', review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', as quoted in Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 175. While Roger Ebert criticized the matinée screening, he admitted that he "admires the movie itself". Critic Rex Reed wrote, "If you want to see what turns a B movie into a classic [...] don't miss ''Night of the Living Dead''. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it."Rex Reed, quoted at . Retrieved June 24, 2006.
Since the release, some critics and film historians have seen ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a subversive film that critiques 1960s American society, international Cold War politics and domestic racism. Elliot Stein of ''The Village Voice'' saw the film as an ardent critique of American involvement in the Vietnam War, arguing that it "was not set in Transylvania, but Pennsylvania - this was Middle America at war, and the zombie carnage seemed a grotesque echo of the conflict then raging in Vietnam".Elliot Stein, , ''The Village Voice'' (New York), January 7, 2003. Retrieved December 1, 2012. Film historian Sumiko Higashi concurs, arguing that ''Night of the Living Dead'' was a film about the horrors of the Vietnam era. While she admits that "there are no Vietnamese in ''Night of the Living Dead'', [...] they constitute an absent presence whose significance can be understood if narrative is construed". She points to aspects of the Vietnam War paralleled in the film: grainy black-and-white newsreels, search and destroy operations, helicopters, and graphic carnage.Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 181. In the 2009 documentary film ''Nightmares in Red, White and Blue'', the zombies in the film are compared to the "silent majority" of the U.S. in the late 1960s.
While George Romero denies he hired Duane Jones simply because he was black, reviewer Mark Deming notes that "the grim fate of Duane Jones, the sole heroic figure and only African-American, had added resonance with the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X fresh in the minds of most Americans".Mark Deming, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. Stein adds, "In this first-ever subversive horror movie, the resourceful black hero survives the zombies only to be killed by a redneck posse". The deaths of Ben, Barbra and the supporting cast offered audiences an uncomfortable, nihilistic glimpse unusual for the genre.Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror'', pp. 117-118.
Other prevalent themes included "disillusionment with government and patriarchal nuclear family" and "the flaws inherent in the media, local and federal government agencies, and the entire mechanism of civil defense".Gregory A. Waller, Introduction to ''American Horrors'', p. 4. Film historian Linda Badley explains that the film was so horrifying because the monsters were not creatures from outer space or some exotic environment, "They're us".Linda Badley, ''Film, Horror, and the Body Fantastic'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995), p. 25, ISBN 978-0-313-27523-4 . Romero confessed that the film was designed to reflect the tensions of the time: "It was 1968, man. Everybody had a 'message'. The anger and attitude and all that's there is just because it was the Sixties. We lived at the farmhouse, so we were always into raps about the implication and the meaning, so some of that crept in".
Respected commentators (Locke, Sutter, Giddins, and Daniel) continue their claim that this film is worth praise as it is both ground-breaking and thought-provoking. Their assertion is framed to suggest that NotLD demystifies the discourse pertaining to humanity's disregard, aversion, and perhaps, loathing, directed towards others outside their social realm from the halls of academia and into the homes of the viewer for reflective analysis.
Romero revolutionized the horror film genre with ''Night of the Living Dead''; according to Almar Haflidason of the BBC, the film represented "a new dawn in horror film-making".Almar Haflidason, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', March 20, 2001, at . Retrieved June 24, 2006. The film has also effectively redefined the use of the term "zombie". While the word "zombie" itself is never used-the word used in the film is ''ghoul''-Romero's film introduced the theme of zombies as reanimated, flesh-eating cannibals.Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 3.Andrew Tudor, ''Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie'' (Oxford, Eng.: Blackwell Publishing, 1989), p. 101, ISBN 978-0-631-16992-5 .W.

Early zombie films like Victor Hugo Halperin|Victor Halperin's ''White Zombie'' (1932) and Jacques Tourneur's ''I Walked with a Zombie'' (1943) concerned living people enslaved by a Voodoo witch doctor, not flesh-eating, decaying, reanimated bodies; many were set in the Caribbean.
The film and its successors spawned countless imitators, in cinema, television and video gaming, which borrowed elements invented by Romero. ''Night of the Living Dead'' ushered in the splatter film subgenre. As one film historian points out, horror prior to Romero's film had mostly involved rubber masks and costumes, cardboard sets, or mysterious figures lurking in the shadows. They were set in locations far removed from rural and suburban America.Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror'', p. 117. Romero revealed the power behind exploitation and setting horror in ordinary, unexceptional locations and offered a template for making an "effective and lucrative" film on a "minuscule budget".Adam Rockoff, ''Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2002), p.35, ISBN 978-0-7864-1227-3. Slasher films of the 1970s and 80s such as John Carpenter's ''Halloween'' (1978), Sean S. Cunningham's ''Friday the 13th'' (1980), and Wes Craven's ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984) "owe much to the original ''Night of the Living Dead''", according to author Barry Keith Grant.Grant, "Taking Back the ''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 201.
The first revisions of ''Night of the Living Dead'' involved colorization by home video distributors. Hal Roach Studios released a colorized version in 1986 that featured ghouls with pale green skin.

''Night of the Living Dead'' is the first of six ''...of the Dead'' films directed by George Romero. Following the 1968 film, Romero released ''Dawn of the Dead'', ''Day of the Dead'', ''Land of the Dead'', ''Diary of the Dead'' and ''Survival of the Dead''. Each film traces the evolution of the living dead epidemic in the United States and humanity's desperate attempts to cope with it. As in ''Night of the Living Dead'', Romero peppered the other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods in which they were released.
The same year ''Day of the Dead'' premiered, ''Night of the Living Dead'' co-writer John Russo released a film titled ''The Return of the Living Dead'' that offers an alternate continuity to the original film than ''Dawn of the Dead'', but acted more as a parody or satire and is not considered a sequel to the original 1968 film. Russo's film spawned four sequels. ''Return of the Living Dead'' sparked a legal battle with Romero, who believed Russo marketed his film in direct competition with ''Day of the Dead'' as a sequel to the original film. In the case ''Dawn Associates v. Links'', Romero accused Russo of "appropriat[ing] part of the title of the prior work", plagiarizing ''Dawn of the Dead'''s advertising slogan ("When there is no more room in hell [...] the dead will walk the earth"), and copying stills from the original 1968 film. Romero was ultimately granted a restraining order that forced Russo to cease his advertising campaign. Russo, however, was allowed to retain his title.Patrick J. Flinn, ''Handbook of Intellectual Property Claims and Remedies: 2004 Supplement'' (New York: Aspen Publishers, 1999), pp. 24-25, ISBN 978-0-7355-1125-5 .
George Cameron Romero, the son of director George A. Romero, was in pre-production on ''Origins'' in 2012. The film would serve as a prequel to the original film.
Starting in 2015, and working from the original camera negatives and audio track elements, a 4K digital restoration of ''Night of the Living Dead'' was undertaken by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and The Film Foundation.
The first remake, debuting in 1990, was directed by special effects artist Tom Savini. It was based on the original screenplay, but included more gore and a revised plot that portrayed BarbraThe character's name is spelled ''Barbara'' in the remake, not ''Barbra''. (Patricia Tallman) as a capable and active heroine. Tony Todd played the role of Ben. Film historian Barry Grant saw the new Barbra as a corrective on the part of Romero. He suggests that the character was made stronger to rectify the depiction of female characters in the original film.Barry Keith Grant, "Taking Back the ''Night of the Living Dead'': George Romero, Feminism and the Horror Film" , in ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', ed. Barry K. Grant (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1996), ISBN 978-0-292-72794-6 .
The second remake was in 3-D and released in September 2006 under the title ''Night of the Living Dead 3D'', directed by Jeff Broadstreet. Unlike Savini's 1990 film, Broadstreet's project was not affiliated with Romero.''Night of the Living Dead 3-D'' . Retrieved June 24, 2006.

'''''Black Demons''''' (released on video as '''''Demoni 3''''') is a 1991 Italian horror film directed by Umberto Lenzi. It was written by Lenzi and his wife Olga Pehar, and the zombie makeup fx were handled by Franco Casagni.  Lenzi said in later interviews that this was one of his favorite films, but he felt it was ruined by some of the shoddy actors he was forced to work with. Lenzi intended the film to be called ''Black Demons'', and he did not like it when the film was later retitled ''Demoni 3'' on video, because some people thought it was part of Lamberto Bava's ''Demons'' series, which it had absolutely nothing to do with.
Lamberto Bava also directed a film in 1988 for Italian TV entitled ''The Ogre'' (aka ''House of the Ogre''), which was released on video in the USA as ''Demons III: The Ogre''. Despite the American title, it is also not related in any way to Bava's ''Demons'' series.  The film that was actually ''intended'' to be ''Demoni 3'' was instead released as ''The Church'' (''La Chiesa''), produced by Dario Argento, directed by Michele Soavi and written by Argento, Soavi and Franco Ferrini (see more detailed explanation under entry for
Lamberto Bava). Digital Retribution

'''''The Battery''''' is a 2012 American independent drama horror film and the directorial debut of Jeremy Gardner. The film stars Gardner and co-producer Adam Cronheim as two former baseball players trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. The film premiered at the Telluride Horror Show in October 2012 and received a video-on-demand release June 4, 2013.  It has won audience awards at several international film festivals.
After a zombie apocalypse has overtaken the entire New England area, two former baseball players, Ben (Jeremy Gardner) and Mickey (Adam Cronheim), travel the back-roads of Connecticut with no destination in mind. Their backstory reveals that they were trapped in a house in Massachusetts, along with Mickey's family, for three months. Mickey's father, mother and brother were killed before they figured out how to escape. Since then, Ben opposes sleeping indoors and the two have had many arguments regarding the matter. Ben has long adapted to their new lifestyle, which includes scavenging for supplies and constantly being on the move. Mickey, on the other hand, longs for a "normal" life. He refuses to learn basic survival skills, and constantly isolates himself by listening to his CD player with headphones on, burning through batteries.
At Mickey's girlfriend's now-abandoned house, Ben finds two walkie-talkies. As they test the walkie-talkies' range, they overhear a conversation between two survivors, Annie and "The Orchard", implying they belong to an organized group of survivors. Mickey eagerly contacts them and asks to join, only to be flatly refused. Despite Ben's advice, Mickey tries contacting them again several times, but no one replies.
The duo travel further and explore a house inside a forest, where Mickey proposes sleeping inside. Ben relents, presumably to ease his friend's frustration, but keeps Mickey's CD player for the night. That evening, Ben drinks, listens to music and dances, while Mickey speaks on the walkie talkie. Annie replies, this time firmly tells him to stay off the channel and stop contacting her group.
The following morning, Ben discovers a zombie tied up near the house and releases it in Mickey's room. He keeps the door shut while urging Mickey to kill it with the baseball bat he left in the room earlier. After the sound of the struggle stops, Ben opens the door, discovering his friend has successfully scored his first zombie kill. Mickey angrily attacks Ben and storms outside. As Ben tries to cheer him up, Mickey breaks down in tears, telling Ben of his conversation with Annie.
Killing his first zombie and getting turned down by a community seem to have changed Mickey. He starts heeding Ben's advice, learns to fish and spends much less time with his headphones on. As the two stop by the road to inspect a car, a man takes Mickey hostage with a knife, and orders Ben to give him their car keys. Ben tricks the man into letting Mickey go, then shoots and kills him. Immediately after, two other survivors arrive. The woman explains that the man stole the car from them, and says Ben did the right thing. Her companion Egghead refuels the abandoned car and they prepare to leave. Mickey, recognizing Annie's voice from the walkie talkie, calls her by name. Annie, not wanting them to follow her to her group, shoots Ben in the leg and throws their car keys into a large grassy area, then leaves with Egghead. As it is too dark to find the keys, Ben and Mickey decide to sleep in the car.
Their car soon becomes surrounded by zombies. As Ben cannot move fast due to his wound, the two are forced to spend an undetermined amount of days inside the car. They finally decide that Mickey should get out via the sunroof and try to find the car keys. When he returns, Ben finds out that he was bitten and is forced to shoot him. The movie ends with Ben talking to the walkie-talkie, claiming he will come and kill Annie to avenge Mickey's death. The mid-credit shows Ben has escaped the car and is walking down the road, with a horde of zombies shambling behind him.
The film cost $6,000 to make and was shot in 15 days in Connecticut.  The scenes were not planned in advance, and director Jeremy Gardner described it as "very seat-of-the pants."
The film premiered at the Telluride Horror Show, a horror/genre film festival in Telluride, Colorado, and was released through various video-on-demand services on June 4, 2013. The film was released on DVD in America on September 16, 2014.
Lauren Taylor of Bloody Disgusting rated the film 4.5/5 stars and said it is "an excellent example of what can truly be considered horror."

During a time in the near future, Gothenburg has been invaded by zombies. The police are powerless and a team of German zombie hunters are called in to solve the problem and clean up the city and find out what is causing the zombie epidemic. On their way through the streets of Gothenburg, they run into several obstacles. For example, they come across an Italian assassin and some Swedish reporters on the wrong side of the barricades.
Over 21 bands contributed to the soundtrack, among them Dark Funeral and Sturm Café. Sturm Café's song "Die Zombiejäger" was written for the film and is used as a main theme throughout the movie. "Godhate" by Dark Funeral is played in the opening credits and "Related Skin" by Red Cell is played during the final battle and over the closing credits. Aardia wrote the original score. A soundtrack was released featuring several of the more prominent songs. There were some controversy when it turned out the producers did not have the right to release the songs on a soundtrack CD. Wolcher was not prosecuted however.

'''''Route 666''''' is a 2001 action/horror film directed by William Wesley and starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Lori Petty, Steven Williams, L.Q. Jones, Dale Midkiff, Alex McArthur, and Mercedes Colon. In the film, government agents are besieged by the ghosts of a massacred chain gang while driving down a desert highway.
Sitting alone at a roadside bar in Arizona, Fred "Rabbit" Smith (Williams) drinks nervously. Two people named Jack La Roca (Phillips) and Stephanie (Petty) enter the bar. Rabbit uses the restroom followed by Jack who handcuffs him. He reveals that he and Steph are Federal Marshals assigned to capture Rabbit and bring him to court in Los Angeles to testify against a mob boss named Benny (Sven-Ole Thorsen) who Rabbit used to work for. He was originally going to testify in exchange for full immunity but ran after learning the mob joined forces with the Russians. They are hunting him, too. Jack calls for a Suburban driven by four other marshals to pick them up before Benny and his mob arrive with heavy firepower. They leave out the back and battle the assassins until marshals; Nick, Mary, PT and Joe arrive between them. They manage to kill all assassins but Benny. Jack and Rabbit use Rabbit's car to escape in the same path as the other marshals (including Steph in the truck). Jack manages to shoot Benny's tires out before leaving.
PT complains to Steph about Jack, believing he isn't trustworthy. She tells him to focus on finding out where they are. Jack tries to find the roads they are using on the map but Rabbit tells him that the back roads are too old and don't have a place on the map except for his old guide. He reads him that a second highway exists next to Route 66 which leads faster to the California border. The road is Route 666 that was condemned after a prison road crew accident. Hearing the story, Jack has strange quick flashbacks of four prisoners digging a hole surrounded by law-enforcement. Meanwhile, Benny shoots a tourist and takes his Jeep. The marshals arrive at a deserted tourist attraction bordering Route 666 and see a restricted access sign. As Jack debates about using the road, he experiences more flashbacks and tells Steph that he was born around the area and his mother died when he was six and he hardly knew his father. Much to Rabbit's dismay, Jack kicks open the gates and the group drive onto it, Steph rides with Jack and Rabbit.
Unknown to them, a county sheriff's deputy named Gill has been following them. He sees they went down Route 666 and requests for backup on the radio. His father, Sheriff Conaway, denies and tells him to leave the road. Gill ignores and pulls the two vehicles over. Jack and PT confront him and Gill abusively tells them the road is restricted. Jack shows him his badge and he leaves irritated. They drive along until they spot a cemetery along the road and stop there. Jack and Steph explore the graveyard, finding Jack's father, John La Roca's grave. PT sees the grave along with three others next to it are the graves of Miles Hackman, Frank Slater and Steven Pikowski. PT explains that all but John La Roca were infamous murderers from the 1960s. La Roca was a bank robber who quit robbing after marrying a woman in a small town and having a baby, Jack. After six years there was no more money for his family so he tried to rob a bank but was caught and thrown in the same prison as Hackman, Slater and Pikowski.
PT suddenly realizes La Roca is Jack's father. They soon start to fight each other. Mary and Nick leave Joe to watch Rabbit while they go back into the Suburban and have sex. Behind Joe, Benny appears and fires at the two with a silenced gun. Before he can reach Rabbit Joe stabs Benny and takes his gun. Blood rushes out of Benny's back which suddenly attracts the decomposed walking corpses of Slater, La Roca, Pikowski and Hackman. They capture Joe and drag him to the road where they pound his back into the asphalt with a jackhammer. While screaming at Nick and Mary to get out of the Suburban, Rabbit takes the silencer off the gun and fires at the zombies, alerting everyone else. The team battles the undead with no effect and they escape the area. Jack stays behind to slow the zombies and uses the stolen Jeep to escape but crashes.
Jack wakes up in a cave next to a native, explaining that he found him and brought him here. He tells him that he us restore peace to the cursed road because haunted spirits still walk it. A confused Jack thanks the man and leaves. Nick leaves to smoke in the Suburban. He slowly falls asleep until Slater slams his fingers off with the car door and slams his head with a sledge hammer. He travels along the road until he sees the two vehicles with their tires melted at a ruined drive-in theatre and is reunited with the rest of the group.
The group goes to check in on Nick while Rabbit stays handcuffed to a pole and stomps a Scorpion, exposing much blood. Rabbit turns around to see Pikowski's zombie swinging a pick axe at him and missing. Rabbit manages to pull the pole out and escape with Pikowski not following. He catches up with the group and sees that Nick is missing. Rabbit thinks and establishes that the zombies can only travel on the road and concrete/cement and they appear from underground. Jack spots an old telephone booth and successfully dials 911, connecting with Sheriff Conaway. Jack gives him the number of the Los Angeles Marshal's office and tells him to call the office and request backup. He agrees and hangs up.
After four hours of waiting, Jack has another flashback and sees his father, Slater, Hackman and Pikowski working on a road when Hackman pulls out a knife and attempts to escape while John hides under a machine and tries to stay away from the trouble. The escape fails and the unseen police office in charge makes them start digging a large hole. Hearing sirens, they spot Sheriff Conaway along with his deputies, Tim and Gill. Jack and Rabbit go to the bathroom stall while Conaway and his officers hold everyone else at gunpoint. Conaway demands to know where Jack is; only hearing that Jack is dead. Conaway shoots Mary in order to make PT tell them that Jack and Rabbit are in the stall. Tim and Gil grab Rabbit who is wearing Jack's badge to confuse them and brings him outside. Jack draws Gil out and points a gun at his head when he enters his truck.
They drive further away and Jack handcuffs Gil to the truck and breaks his nose. He begs for him to not stay on the road, stating the zombies kill anything on the road. Jack asks why when the four zombies rise again and start approaching. Gil uncuffs himself but is too late as they knock him down and kill him with the jackhammer. Jack drives back and Conaway goes to the truck thinking Gil is in it and PT fights Tim who drops his shotgun but is able to shoot PT in the stomach with his pistol. Rabbit picks up the shotgun and shoots Tim, saying "There's a new Marshal in town". Jack punches Conaway multiple times and restrains him to the SUV. Conaway starts bleeding and asks where his son is. Jack doesn't reply and Conaway slowly realizes that the zombies put him in the road.
He explains that they travel under the road and feed on blood to stay strong or they are unable to rise from underground and that blood awakens them. Jack wonders how Conaway knows so much about the zombies and has a final flashback. It is night and the unseen boss is Sheriff Conaway whom the prison warden put in charge of the gang. Though La Roca didn't assist in the attempted escape, he is knocked unconscious and thrown into the hole dug by the three others. Conaway and his men open fire at the convicts in their legs, keeping them alive and preventing them to move out of the hole. Conaway plans to tell the warden that there was an accident and the convicts were caught under the roller. He starts the steam roller and buries the four men alive. Conaway and his thugs learn about the zombies return and they were killing anyone whoever set foot on the road to cover up the crime and the zombies.
Jack finally realizes this and continuously yells and brutally punches at Conaway. Conaway begs him not to be in the road. Suddenly, the zombies arrive. They pin Jack down and Conaway tries to enter the SUV but Rabbit knocks him out. He and Steph are unable to kill the zombies by gunfire as the jackhammer is brought up. Jack looks at John and yells with sympathy that he is his son. After seconds, John suddenly snaps and pushes the jackhammer into Slater's stomach, destroying his spirit and body. He then kills Hackman with the jackhammer which stops working. Pikowski hits John multiple times with the hammer until he loses too much blood energy. Jack cuts his hand with a knife and embraces it into his father's hand. With enough energy, John thanks his son and chokes Pikowski, killing him.
John tears off his dog tag and gives it to Jack. John is then able to walk onto the dirt and crosses the afterlife into Heaven, finally lifting the curse on Route 666. Conaway emerges from the SUV and he was going to shoot them until Jack, Steph and Rabbit shoot him everywhere. He falls barely stable to the ground and has an unseen vision of an even larger steam roller (as the Grim Reaper) coming towards him. He shoots at it with no effect and it crushes him. Jack, Steph and Rabbit walk alone along Route 666 to head to the Arizona/California border as Jack finally pieces together what the native said to him. With Sheriff Conaway and his thugs dead Route 666 is now peaceful once more. Jack, Steph and Rabbit walk along the sunset and they know that the curse has been finally lifted.

Critical reception for ''Morituris'' has been mixed, with some decrying what they saw as extreme misogyny and gratuitous scenes of rape.
''Bloody Disgusting'' staff reviewer "Mr Disgusting" was highly critical of the movie, giving it "Negative 100 million out of 5 Skulls" and stating "I'm not a sensitive guy (at all), I don't get offended, and frankly I wasn't offended - but ''Morituris'' does show viewers what a disgusting piece of trash the filmmaker is. Every single thing that happens comes with such a complete lack in taste. So to the director and the movie: f*ck off." They also used some scenes, such as a cutaway to a man in another location inserting a mouse into a woman's vagina, to show that "some crimes happens not only in the hidden of a forest but also in the core of a metropolis like Rome".

'''''Zombie Hunter''''' is a 2013 American direct-to-video action-thriller film directed and written by Kevin King for The Klimax and Arrowstorm Entertainment. The film stars Danny Trejo, Martin Copping and Clare Niederpruem. It follows a group of humans, led by Jesús (Trejo), defending themselves from flesh-devouring zombies. A fundraising campaign was hosted on the website Kickstarter to help fulfill the production team's desired budget. The film had its official premiere at the 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal, and was released on home media on October 8, 2013. It was a critical failure, garnering mostly negative reviews.
The film opens with a news report on "Natas", a strange drug which has been reported to induce zombie-like effects in those who consume it. The film then fast forwards in time, to an Earth mostly inhabited by zombies. The Hunter (Martin Copping) drives along a post-apocalyptic wasteland and meets a hostile "Death Angel". The zombie is reduced to purplish goo after Hunter rams his car at it. He proceeds to stop at a deserted filling station to fill his car's empty gas tank. Hunter enters the station's convenience store to check out any available supplies, but is ambushed by invading zombies. He eliminates them all after a gory battle and downs his sorrows by gulping a bottle of tequila. It is revealed that Hunter's daughter and wife have both died. Resuming his journey, Hunter unknowingly ventures into the turf of the survivors, who have not been infected by Natas. Thinking Hunter is a zombie, an unknown assailant takes a shot at him. Hunter survives nevertheless and is greeted by survivor Fast Lane Debbie (Jade Regier) upon regaining consciousness.
A flirty Debbie attempts to make out with Hunter but fellow survivor Alison (Clare Niederpruem) awkwardly walks into the room to hand him a can of cola, before coercing an annoyed Debbie to leave Hunter alone. Outside, Debbie accuses Alison of being a slut. The latter woman throws back the same insult and they start to quarrel. The audience is then introduced to Father Jesús (Danny Trejo), a pastor-like zombie slayer and leader of the survivor's colony. As the survivors assemble in a small room to have a meal together, a groggy Hunter joins the crowd and gets to formally know the other survivors. Alison and Hunter start to get romantically passionate with each other.
All is well until a wave of normal zombies and a monstrously large zombie somehow make their way into the survivor's camp. The survivors are able to fend off the normal zombies but the gigantic zombie is seemingly unstoppable to the point that even bullets do not faze it. Jesús rushes in to save them and is able to mutilate the hulking zombie with his axe by slicing off its arm. However, Jesús is unable to defeat him wholly and as a result, the zombie slices off his head. The remaining survivors scramble into a car and drive off to an airport in hopes of being able to find a working aeroplane to fly off with.
The zombies, unshakable, still manage to track them down. Consequently, all of the survivors, except for Alison, Hunter, and Alison's brother Ricky (Jason K. Wixom), are killed. Mustering their courage, they confront the zombies and begin shooting them. At last, only the giant zombie is left. Having run out of bullets, Hunter is impaled by the sharp-clawed zombie. Nonetheless, he miraculously finds the energy to detonate a grenade, wiping out the creature and destroying the rundown airport. Just as the bomb explodes, Alison and Ricky climb into a truck and drive off to safety.
Alison vows to always remember Hunter and his courageous deed, echoing that he had finally found what he yearned for - peace. In the aftermath of the explosion, Hunter is shown to be still alive. He explains that he feels cursed as the zombies never seem to be able to kill him and decides to take his own life before the credits roll.

The film stars Danny Trejo, Martin Copping, Clare Niederpruem, Terry Guthrie, Jake Suazo, Jason K. Wixom and Jade Reiger. It was directed and written by Kevin King. King was also in charge of production for The Klimax and Arrowstorm Entertainment, alongside Chris Le and Jennifer Griffin. Kynan Griffin, Jason Faller, Brian King, Rocky Mudaliar, Sultan Saeed Al Darmaki, Brett Bozeman, Doug Miller and Spencer Bowen served as executive producers. Ephraim Smith headed the cinematography. Chris Le edited the film. The film's music was composed by Christian Davis.
As the budget then was not sufficient to allow for better visual effects and others, additional funds for the film, totalling to $46,254 were raised through the website Kickstarter.
The film was premiered at the 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival, which was held from July 18 to August 16 in Montreal. International sales were handled by the Highland Film Group. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc by Well Go USA, with both single and double disc sets available, on October 8, 2013.
The film received predominantly negative reviews from contemporary film critics. Bill Gibron of ''DVD Verdict'' found the film to be "[a] goofy, god-awful mess", criticising all the actors' acting skills with the exception of Trejo's. He also opined that the film "[was] lacking in legitimate entertainment value that camp may be all it's capable of." In concluding his review, Gibron wrote, "When you hire Danny Trejo and give your movie a title like Zombie Hunter, you better be prepared to deliver the horror geek goods. Kevin King can't and won't. Instead, he hopes borrowing from his betters would work. It doesn't."
Éric S. Boisvert, writing for the Fantasia International Film Festival, gave the film a rare positive review, describing it as a "bounty of pure entertainment" and "a simple yet highly effective work that has all the hallmarks of a great midnight movie." He also felt that "[t]he '80s soundtrack, the allure of the actresses and occasionally maladroit delivery of some actors make the whole thing all the more rewarding."

'''''The House by the Cemetery''''' (Italian: '''''Quella villa accanto al cimitero''''') is a 1981 Italian supernatural horror film directed by Lucio Fulci. The film stars Catriona MacColl, Paolo Malco, Ania Pieroni, Giovanni Frezza, Silvia Collatina and Dagmar Lassander. It is the third instalment of the unofficial ''Gates of Hell'' trilogy which also includes ''City of the Living Dead'' and ''The Beyond''. Its plot revolves around a series of murders taking place in a New England home-a home which happens to be hiding a particularly gruesome secret within its basement walls. Themes and motifs from popular horror films such as ''The Shining'', ''The Amityville Horror'' and ''Frankenstein'' are readily on display. This movie made the infamous video nasty list in the United Kingdom.
A woman (Daniela Doria) is in an abandoned house looking for her boyfriend. After she discovers his body stabbed with scissors, she is stabbed in the head with a French knife, and her body is dragged through a cellar door.
In New York City, Bob (Giovanni Frezzi) and his parents, Norman and Lucy Boyle (Paolo Malco and Catriona MacColl), are moving into the same house. Norman's ex-colleague, Dr. Peterson, who murdered his mistress before committing suicide, was the previous owner. The Boyles are to stay there, whilst Norman researches old houses. As his mother packs, Bob looks at a photograph of a house and notices a girl in it. In New Whitby, Boston, Bob waits in his parents' car while they collect the house keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae (Silvia Collatina), whom only Bob can see, warns him to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Gittelson (Dagmar Lassander) is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple "the Freudstein" keys. She insists it is called "Oak Mansion". Gittelson promises to find the Boyles a babysitter.
Oak Mansion is in a poor state of repair. The cellar door is locked and nailed shut. A woman arrives and introduces herself as Ann, the babysitter (Ania Pieroni). That night, Norman hears noises and finds Ann unblocking the cellar door. The next day, Norman goes to the library to peruse Peterson's materials. The chief librarian, Mr. Wheatley (Carlo De Mejo), appears to recognize him. but Norman claims he is mistaken. The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas (Giampaolo Saccarola), then informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data.
Mae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked "Mary Freudstein" and says she is not really buried there. Indoors, Lucy finds the tombstone of "Jacob Tess Freudstein" while sweeping the hallway. When Norman returns, he reassures her that some older houses have indoor tombs because of the hard wintry ground. Norman opens the cellar door and walks down the stairs, only be attacked by a bat, which won't let go until he stabs it repeatedly. Spooked, the family drives down to the real estate office and demands to be re-housed, but are told it will be few more days before they can move. While the Boyles are at hospital to treat Norman's injuries from the bat, Gittelson arrives at the house to tell them of a new property. Letting herself in, she stands over the Freudstein tombstone, which cracks apart, pinning her ankle. A figure emerges, stabs her in the neck with a fireplace poker, and drags her into the cellar.
The next morning, Lucy finds Ann cleaning a bloodstain on the kitchen floor. Ann eludes Lucy's questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he's discovered that Freudstein was a Victorian surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman drops by the library and finds a cassette of Peterson's, which explains Freudstein killed his family. Ann goes to the cellar looking for Bob, but Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat. Bob sees Ann's head, and exits screaming. Lucy refuses to believe Bob's tale about Ann. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Ann but gets locked in. Lucy hears Bob's cries and tries to open the cellar door. When she cannot open it, Norman returns and attacks it with an hatchet. The rotting hands of Freudstein (Giovanni De Nava) appear and restrain Bob. Norman cuts the monster's hand off, and he staggers away, bleeding.
Norman and Lucy finally get into the cellar, which contains several mutilated bodies (including Ann, the realtor, and the couple from the beginning of the film), surgical equipment, and a slab. Freudstein is a living corpse with rotting flesh. Norman tells Lucy that the 150-year-old Freudstein lives by using his victims' parts to regenerate blood cells. Norman attacks Freudstein, but the ghoul twists the hatchet away. He grabs a dagger off a tray and stabs Freudstein. Freudstein picks up Norman and rips his throat out. Lucy and Bob climb a ladder leading to the cracked tombstone. Lucy strains to shift the stone, but Freudstein grabs her and drags her down the stairs. Freudstein kills Lucy by ramming her head into the concrete floor. As Freudstein advances up the ladder, Bob strains to escape. As Freudstein grabs Bob's leg, he is suddenly yanked upwards by Mae. With Mae is her mother, Mary Freudstein (Teresa Rossi Passante), who tells them it's time to leave. Freudstein leads Mae and Bob down the wintry grove into a netherworld of ghosts and sadness.

Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 38%, based on 
''Time Out'' called the film "a hack-work of almost awesome incoherence".
''House'' was released in its native country Italy around August 1981 and other countries in Europe between 1982 and 1983.
The film was finally released to U.S. theaters and drive-ins across America around June 1, 1984
from the now out of business US distributor Almi Pictures.
In the United Kingdom, the film has had a history of problems with the BBFC over the years. The original cinema version was heavily cut with edits to the poker murder and the slashing of Ann's throat, and this print was later released on video prior to the UK's Video Recordings Act 1984 and subsequently banned as a video nasty. The film was made officially available in 1988, though the print had been pre-edited by 34 seconds (removing the cinema cuts) and then additionally cut by 4 minutes 11 seconds with further cuts to the opening stabbing, the bat attack, Norman's throat being torn out by Freudstein and tracking shots of mutilated bodies in the basement. The film was again released in 1992 with this version heavily pre-cut by the distributors, removing 7 minutes 27 seconds of footage and rendering much of the film unintelligible. The 2001 Vipco DVD issue restored nearly all of the film's prior edits but was cut by 33 secs by the BBFC with lesser edits made to the poker murder and a throat cutting. Although willing to release the movie uncut, the film had recently been prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act following the discovery of bootleg copies of the uncut version, leaving the BBFC no choice but to cut the film. All the cuts were finally waived for the 2009 Arrow DVD.
The Anchor Bay DVD version was later released uncut, containing all the gore and violence from the original version.
The film was released by Blue Underground on Blu-ray (as well as a new DVD edition) on 25 October 2011 with a new 2K transfer.

'''''They Walk''''' is the first feature-length film directed by Charles House II. The film follows five groups of survivors, each modeled after an era of zombie cinema, after a meteor shower brings the reanimation of the recently deceased. The film was independently produced and shot primarily in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
The film starts by following a young couple, John and Nicole, through a graveyard, shortly after leaving a party. While the couple hears distant sounds, small meteorites hitting the ground nearby, and are well aware of the meteor shower passing that night, they distract themselves, and John is hit in the back with a meteorite. He is killed while lying on top of Nicole, who passes out from his dead weight. She wakes to find him gone, and in searching for him, finds he has turned into some sort of creature, a zombie.
Back at the party, a large group of friends drinks and ignores the meteor shower, and where their friends may have gone. In the morning, some of the party-goers have disbursed, and John's roommate Dennis, and his girlfriend Lisa, become worried about them. They join the party-goers from the night before and discuss what to do to remain safe, having seem the aftermath of the zombie outbreak on the news and when driving through town. The group forms four separate plans and takes up arms, just before finding the reanimated John and Nicole in the front yard and dealing with them. One of the home owners, Mike, is killed in the fray just before the others leave.
Stephen, the owner of the party home, having put an end to his roommate Mike after being fatally wounded and torn apart by the reanimated couple, begins to get drunk and regale himself with stories from his past. He arms himself with a revolver and spends time thinking about his roommate, the current situation, and his life prior to the epidemic. He remembers a high school love, Suzie, and how they stopped talking just before graduation. To his surprise, Suzie finds herself knocking at his door, her family having been killed. She has been bit, and Stephen must decide how to handle her, knowing that the bites are fatal and what will become of her.
Two couples, Scott and Lauren and friends Eric and Sarah, decide to pack up supplies and head to somewhere that they might be able to fortify, a more expendable place, rather than board up Stephen's apartment in the event that the epidemic would be short-lived. They come upon a stranded man, Brian, who tells them of an abandoned house he was aware of. The group fortifies the rather run-down abandoned house, boarding windows and learning to use their weapons. Lauren has been scratched in the fray with John and Nicole, and Sarah tends to the wound. When the undead make their way into the first floor of the house, the group head upstairs and burn the staircase, leaving them safe, but without a way down. Brian later admits he did not search the upstairs fully, and this coupled with Lauren's slow but potential death add to the group's dire situation.
Dennis and Lisa decide to flee in their car rather than returning home, assuming that the epidemic was localized. They find the back roads to be the safest, but eerily empty, as if those fleeing by car had left hours before. When signal is available, the radio tells of the outbreak being a highly debated topic, some suggesting the undead to simply be sick people, mentally or physically, while others suggest it to be the end of times. After hours of driving, the couple hit a roadblock, abandoned cars and bodies lying along the road randomly, but only occasionally. They arm themselves with firearms found in the trunk of an abandoned vehicle, but the roadblock appears to be the end of the road for the couple entirely.
The front man for a local rock band leaves Stephen's apartment at leisure and takes his time getting back to his band and playing their scheduled show as if nothing were unusual. This proves to be somewhat of a mistake, and the band members pay for the mistake.
A group of punk rockers, a "band" themselves, though having no real songs or talent, had left the party early, complaining about the "losers who can't hold their booze." In the morning, the leader of group, Hogger, and his girlfriend Engine, find their roommates gone. They return with boxes of stolen goods, babbling about the crazed city and the "sickos" shambling about, one of which has taken a bite out of the roommate's arm. Dismemberment, B-movie antics, and an arm-mounted weapon made from a flower pot, shotguns, and zip ties follow.
The soundtrack and score consists of entirely original music created by CJM Venter. Venter had originally met the director on a musician's forum, and promptly began creating a number of themes for the five groups, as well as the main theme, which is shadowed throughout the film in different ways. The soundtrack also features music from The Demon Beat (guitarist Adam Meisterhans playing the unnamed "Guitarist" character in the film), The Goddamn Hills, and Jessie Jenkins.
The film premiered at the first annual Zombcon in Seattle, Washington in 2010. Though this cut was a Festival Cut, primarily released to meet this event's date over Halloween weekend, the film was available for sale on DVD on a limited basis at the event and online. The final cut will be premiered in Shepherdstown, WV on March 29, 2011. It is expected to play at a number of horror and independent film festivals and events.

'''''American Zombie''''' is a 2007 American mockumentary horror film directed by Grace Lee, written by Rebecca Sonnenshine and Lee, and starring Lee and John Solomon as documentary filmmakers who investigate a fictional subculture of real-life zombies living in Los Angeles.
John Solomon, a documentary filmmaker, recruits Grace Lee to investigate the zombie subculture of Los Angeles.  Solomon is convinced that the zombies are dangerous and wishes to expose them, but Lee takes a more sympathetic view.  Zombies are divided into three different categories: the feral, George A. Romero|Romero-style zombies that exhibit no sentience; low-functioning zombies that can work simple menial jobs, such as sweatshops; and high-functioning zombies that do not retain their memories or personality but can pass as human.  At first open and welcoming, the zombies become evasive and warn the documentary crew away from a private ceremony at an upcoming zombie festival.  There, the crew discovers that the rumors of cannibalism are not simply an ignorant cultural stereotype.

'''''Autumn''''' is a 2009 Canadian horror film directed by Steven Rumbelow, written by David Moody and Rumbelow, and starring Dexter Fletcher.  It was based on Moody's self-published novel ''Autumn''.  Fletcher plays a schoolteacher who must survive in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by evolving zombies.
After a viral outbreak kills 99% of the world's population, scattered survivors come together and attempt to deal with the fall of civilization.  They face a new threat when the dead begin to reanimate.  Initially catatonic, the corpses slowly regain their senses, become increasingly sensitive to outside stimuli, and show signs of aggression.  Eventually, the survivors must fortify themselves against attack and try to find a reason to survive.

Author David Moody had offers on two of his novels, ''Autumn'' and ''Hater'', at the same time.  Although ''Hater'' had Guillermo Del Toro attached, Moody reasoned that ''Autumn'', as a small independent film, had a greater chance of being made.  Moody made both deals and participated in the making of ''Autumn''.
''Autumn'' played at the 2009 Grimm Up North Festival in the UK.
Reviewing the film while it was still in post-production, Brutal As Hell wrote that the atmosphere and settings of the film are superior to other post-apocalyptic films.
David Moody, the author of the source novel, said, "Ultimately, although it has some redeeming qualities, and the main cast did a great job, I think it was a disappointment to a lot of people. The filmmakers were really stretched by having to work within a microscopic budget, and there are places where that really shows."  The negative reception of ''Autumn'' led Dexter Fletcher to direct his own films, which were better received.

'''''State of Emergency''''' is a 2011 American horror film written and directed by Turner Clay.  It stars Jay Hayden, Tori White, Scott Lilly, and Kathryn Todd Norman as survivors of a neurotoxin quarantine who have to survive an assault by the infected.
After a chemical plant explodes, the military quarantines the surrounding area.  Jim helplessly watches his girlfriend Emilie die of a wound sustained while trying to find safety, and he retreats to a farmhouse.  Sporadic media reports indicate that the chemical plant may have stored biological weapons that are responsible for mutating people into rabid cannibals.  He seeks help from the ubiquitous military helicopters that patrol the area, but it is to no avail.  However, his efforts are noticed by survivors holed up nearby in a warehouse, and he joins them: Scott, Scott's wife Julie, and Ix, a quiet and unfriendly survivor that they rescued.
Ix initially snaps at Jim for inadvertently taking her candy and rejects his offers of friendship, but she slowly warms  to him.  Ix reveals that her failure to find a job or any friends in a new city led her to return home to live with her parents.  There, she and her parents clashed over her lifestyle, and she stopped talking to them.  Before she could apologize for her behavior, her parents died during the quarantine.  Jim and Ix bond over their loneliness and feelings of loss, though Ix continues to keep her diabetes a secret from everyone.  After she falls into a diabetic coma, Jim leaves the warehouse to find insulin for her.
Jim evades zombies and recovers insulin in emergency supplies airdropped by the military.  When he returns to the warehouse, Jim saves Scott from a zombie attack.  During the night, zombies break in the warehouse, and the survivors retreat upstairs into the offices.  While clearing the warehouse, Jim discovers a squad of Marines, and they tranquilize him.  He wakes up in an observation room, shackled to a chair.  Through a glass window, a scientist explains to Jim that the chemical plant released a neurotoxin into the air that caused people to go homicidal, but tests reveal that Jim, Scott, Julie, and Ix are clean.  The scientist apologizes to Jim and tells him that they're all free to go.  After the group reunites, Jim and Ix embrace.

The film went into production in 1984 and went through numerous re-writes and re-edits before release in 1987.  It is made up of footage of several older films, with major footage coming from the unfinished Dean Jagger film ''God Bless Doctor Shagetz''.  When the pieces of the various older films were patched together, there was inclusion of some new footage, including some with Jillian Kesner-Graver|Jillian Kesner and nude scenes with Playboy Playmate Lynda Wiesmeier.
 
When beginning work on ''Evil Town'' in 1984, director Mardi Rustam liked the story enough to make his own version which he released as ''Evils of the Night'' in 1985,
  two years before the release of ''Evil Town''.
Cavett Binion of All Movie Guide called it a "silly horror film" and noted that it was an assemblage of parts of earlier films, including an unfinished one from the 70s, and that it was "spiced up with some gratuitous nudity courtesy of former Playboy playmate Lynda Wiesmeier."  While remarking that the editor's efforts to maintain continuity were comendable, he concluded that "the end result seems hardly worth the effort".
 
The film was scheduled for release on June 3, 1987, but due to the high level of anticipation for the movie, many theaters began showing it on the evening of June 2, 1987

'''''Zombie King and the Legion of Doom''''', also known as '''''Enter... Zombie King''''' and '''''Zombie Pool Party''''', is a 2003 Canadian comedy horror lucha film directed by Stacey Case, written by Bill Marks and Sean K. Robb, and starring Jules Delmore, Raymond Carle, Jennifer Thom, and Rob "El Fuego" Etcheverria as masked Mexican wrestlers (''luchadores'') who fight zombies.
''Luchadores'' Ulysses and Blue Saint discover that Tiki is wrestling zombies.  Their worries are put to rest when Tiki reveals that the zombies have been domesticated.  However, Tiki's zombies are soon blamed for a wave of violent zombie attacks.  The ''luchadores'' research the attacks and are led to the lair of the Zombie King, who seeks to conquer the world.

* Jim Neidhart as Sheriff Logan
Shooting took place in Toronto over a three-week period in December 2002.  Professional wrestlers were hired to train the actors, but they did not have enough time.  Instead, the wrestlers were brought in as actors and stuntmen.  The film was then rewritten to show off the abilities of the wrestlers.  The Zombie King was originally slated to be played by George A. Romero, but Romero had to bow out due to health concerns.  Wrestler Sinn Bodhi replaced Romero.  Rob "El Fuego" Etcheverria, who played Tiki, also worked as the stunt coordinator.  In order to properly emulate lucha films, the crew intentionally added continuity errors and poor dubbing.  The film was not meant as a parody, though.
On November 21, 2003, the film premiered in Toronto, Ontario.
Meredith Renwick of Canoe.ca called the film "a high-camp, low-budget melange of masked wrestlers, hokey dialogue, spurting blood and gratuitous nudity" that is more fun than bigger-budgeted high concept films.

'''''Battle of the Damned''''' is a 2013 American science fiction film written, produced and directed by Christopher Hatton. The film stars Dolph Lundgren, Melanie Zanetti, Matt Doran and David Field. Following a deadly viral outbreak, private soldier Max Gatling (Lundgren) leads a handful of survivors and a team of robots in a fight against an army of the dead.
Lundgren said of the film, "This time I'm up against virus-infected human zombies, 'Eaters' as we call them. Max is sent into an infected, abandoned city to find the daughter of a rich industrialist. He gets more than he bargained for. 'I wish I would've asked for more money', in Max's own words. Fortunately I enlist some kick-ass, run-away robots to help me in the battle".
A group of mercenaries led by Maj. Max Gatling are fleeing from a failed rescue attempt, having been hired by a rich industrialist to enter a zombie-infested city to rescue his daughter Jude. At the extraction point, Gatling tells Smiley that he is staying to find Jude and complete the mission. After searching through the city and killing many zombies on the way, he locates Jude and tells her that he is going to get her out of the city, and she takes him to other survivors. There, he is introduced to the survivors including group leader Duke, Reese, Elvis, Lynn, and Anna. Jude is revealed to be in a relationship with Reese and pregnant with his child. The next day when Gatling, Jude, and the others go out to retrieve gasoline from a gas station, Gatling attempts to get Jude out of the city by force when she refuses to go without the others. However, he is stopped by the others and left for dead. After discovering that Jude is pregnant, Reese rushes to Gatling's aid so that Jude can be taken out of the city. At this point it is revealed that not only is Jude's father some rich industrialist, but he is also the one who caused the zombie pandemic. While returning to the stronghold to get Jude, Gatling and Reese discover a band of non-programmed robots. Gatling reprograms the robots and proceeds to the stronghold. When it is revealed that the city is to be firebombed, Gatling and all of the survivors make preparations to escape.
On the day of the escape, Gatling, Jude, the survivors, and the robots shoot down and kill many zombies along the way. When taking defensive positions while being attacked at a junkyard, Duke ditches them all and hides away. The robots also malfunction and one begins to attack Gatling. Gatling destroys the robot, and the rest of them reboot. Gatling, Jude, Reese, and the remaining survivors escape the junkyard in a car being pushed by the remaining robots. Duke is left behind and eaten by zombies. Gatling and the others then arrive at a car parking complex and go underground while the robots hold back the zombies. Once the Zombies start swarming the car park, Gatling and the others struggle to fight them off. Gatling finds that one of the robots is still functioning and he sends it to find Jude.
As the firebombing starts and reaches the complex, Gatling, Jude, and Reese jump into a partly flooded level of the complex to escape the fire. Once the firebombing ceases, Jude and Reese leave the complex, and all of the city is shown to be entirely destroyed. They meet up with Gatling, who reveals to Reese that a part of his mission is not only to take Jude home, but to kill anybody that can whistle-blow on the outbreak. But knowing that Jude and Reese are expecting, Gatling decides to let Reese live and the three of them then leave together with the last surviving robot who Max asks to get him a coffee.

''Battle of the Damned'' was met with mixed reviews. Peter Turner of ''Filmoria'' gave it two out of five stars and called it "Damned Disappointing", commenting that "Lundgren may be passed his prime and the zombies far outweigh the robots but ''Battle of the Damned'' does give a lot of bang for its limited bucks."  Neil John Buchanan of ''Starburst'' rated it 8/10 stars and wrote, "Forget ''The Walking Dead'', ''Battle of the Damned'' takes the genre back to its grass roots of horror."

'''''Grub Girl''''' is 2006 pornographic horror film. It is an adaptation of the Verotik comic book of the same name by Edward Lee.
At an unspecified point in the future, the government created a type of jet which never needed refueling but which leaked a type radiation that caused those exposed to it to die and reanimate as intelligent zombies dubbed "Grubs". One of the victims of the radiation is a prostitute whose scarred body is taken to a laboratory, where she wakes up while being sexually abused by a pair of necrophilic scientists, who she kills after deeming what they have done "the worst fuck of my life".
"Grub Girl" adjusts to being a zombie and returns to being a prostitute, discovering that being undead is advantageous to her career, as she is immune to disease and nearly impervious to pain. One night, after making a house call to a married couple, Grub Girl is accosted by her pimp, Rome, who forces her to fellate him in an alley. Sick of Rome's abuse, Grub Girl bites off his penis and rips out and devours his innards.
With Rome gone, Grub Girl becomes a madam and opens a brothel that specializes in Grubs. One customer of the establishment is a bi-curious married woman, who Grub Girl sets up with a pair of her girls, who the patron uses a strap-on dildo on. The film ends with Grub Girl Conversation opener#Conversation openers for romantic purposes|propositioning the prospective customer she had been telling her story to, before breaking the fourth wall by snarking, "Okay, don't act like you've never thought about it before. Why else would you be watching this crummy movie? Now beat it, unless you're throwing some green my way".

The film was originally slated to be produced and distributed by Hustler Video, though Verotik founder Glenn Danzig instead went with Craven Moorehead and Northstar Associates after watching videos Moorehead had directed for pornographer Peter North.
A four out of five was given to ''Grub Girl'' by ''AVN'', which wrote that it was "damn true to the storyline of the original" and that "those who like the macabre will definitely find lots to like".
In the article "The 10 Least Horrifying Horror Movies Ever" written for ''Esquire'', Sean Cunningham listed ''Grub Girl'' as runner-up, behind ''Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood''.
The film was nominated for "Best Video Feature", and Brittney Skye for "Best Actress, Video" at the 2007 AVN Awards.

'''''Horror Hospital''''' (also known as '''''Computer Killers''''') is a 1973 British horror-comedy film starring Robin Askwith, Michael Gough, Dennis Price and Skip Martin. It was the penultimate film directed by Antony Balch. 
When attempts to break into the pop business leaves him with nothing but a bloody nose, songwriter Jason Jones (Robin Askwith) decides to take a break with "Hairy Holidays", an outfit run by shifty, gay travel agent Pollock (Dennis Price). After failing to chat Jason up, Pollock sends him to pseudo-health farm Brittlehurst Manor. On the train journey there Jason meets Judy (Vanessa Shaw) who is also on the way to the same destination to meet her long lost aunt. Both are unaware that the health farm (i.e. "Horror Hospital") is a front for Dr. Storm (Michael Gough) and his lobotomy experiments that turn wayward hippies into his mindless zombie slaves. The wheelchair-bound doctor surrounds himself with an entourage that includes Judy's aunt, erstwhile brothel madam Olga (Ellen Pollock), dwarf Frederick (Skip Martin) and numerous zombie biker thugs. Dr. Storm also has a Rolls Royce fitted with a giant blade that decapitates escapees and interfering parties. Abraham (Kurt Christian) arrives at the Horror Hospital "looking for his chick" and is promptly whacked around the head by the motorcycle zombies. Frederick, fed up at literally being Storm's whipping boy helps the kids escape-paving the way for the '70s' youth to put the final spanner in the works to Storm's scheme.

After the success of his feature film debut ''Secrets of Sex'' (1969), an anthology sex film that flirted with horror themes, Balch envisioned his second film as an out and out horror film and one with a continuous narrative.
Location filming was undertaken in and around Knebworth House near Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
The script was written by Balch and his friend Alan Watson during the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, although the film's title was thought up before the plot. Among Watson's ideas for the ''Horror Hospital'' script was the lethal Rolls Royce, with its giant blade that decapitated people as it drove by.
The film was shot on a four-week schedule beginning on 16 October 1972. Shooting was done at Merton Park (mainly the pop group scene), Battersea Town Hall (which provided the interiors of Brittlehurst Manor) and Knebworth House.
The film's last night party on 11 November was compromised when Phoebe Shaw served cake that was laced with drugs. In his autobiography Askwith wrote "I don't know what she put in the cake but I ended up with a twenty stone electrician Roy, sitting on my lap telling me he thought he was in love with me." Only producer Richard Gordon managed to avoid eating the cake.
Robin Askwith's role was specially written for him after he appeared in Gordon's previous 1972 production ''Tower of Evil''. Balch asked Michael Gough to base his performance on Bela Lugosi, screening him a 16mm print of ''The Devil Bat'', in which Lugosi plays a mad, perfume manufacturer.
The female lead was taken by Phoebe Shaw, who had previously appeared in several TV Commercials, and was renamed 'Vanessa Shaw' for the film.  During filming Shaw and Askwith briefly became lovers. Her only other known roles were an un-credited bit part in a 1969 American TV adaptation of ''David Copperfield'' and brief roles as a boutique assistant in ''Say Hello to Yesterday'' (1970) and a police cadet in ''Ooh… You Are Awful ''(1972).
Veteran character actor, Dennis Price, and 'dwarf' actor Skip Martin, who ran a tobacconist in between acting assignments, also appeared in the film. As well as Kurt Christian whose full title was Baron Kurt Christian Von Siengenberg, and who left the country not long after the film was released. His ambition at the time, according to Films and Filming magazine, was to "play a role that does not involve killing somebody".
Nicky Henson was originally considered for Christian's role.
''Horror Hospital'' also contains a pop music number "Mark of Death", composed by Jason DeHavilland and performed by the group Mystic (James IV Boris, Alan "The River" Hudson, Simon Lust).
Norwich (England) hip-hop group Stonasaurus recorded a concept album about the film in 2003.
The film was originally released on DVD in the US by Elite Entertainment on 2 November 1999. A new remastered DVD with a new commentary from producer Richard Gordon was released by Dark Sky Films on 15 June 2010.  The DVD release is set for 15 June 2010 by MPI Media Group.
The film was re-released on DVD and released for the first time on Blu-ray in the UK from Odeon on 10 August 2015.

During a horror film convention, several people are invited to an exclusive party.

''Mimesis: Night of the Living Dead'' premiered at the Blue Water Film Festival on October 7, 2011.  Sid Haig attended the event.
Anchor Bay Entertainment released it on home video on February 12, 2013.

'''''The Zombie Farm''''' is a 2011 American zombie film written and directed by Ricardo Islas.  It stars Adriana Cataño, Nadia Rowinsky, Khotan, Monika Munoz, and Monika Munoz.  It is about a battered wife, con man, and documentary filmmaker who team up against a voodoo priestess.
Ana Maria, a battered wife, seeks help from a local spiritualist, Roque.  Impressed with Roque's community service and advocacy for women, a filmmaker, Pilar Franco, offers to make a documentary about him.  Roque, however, is a fake and can offer Ana Maria little help beyond advice to leave her abusive relationship; Pilar is disgusted and denounces him as a con man.
In desperation, Ana Maria turns to Luna, a voodoo priestess, who warns her that her husband, Antonio, will be changed by the dark magic. To Ana Maria's surprise, Antonio is transformed into a mindless slave.  Unsure what to do, Ana Maria returns to Roque and seeks his help once again. Roque and Pilar team up to help Ana Maria discover what happened to Antonio.  Together, they learn that Luna is creating slave labor out of the immigrant community now that her supply of illegal immigrants has dried up. These zombies are put to work on Luna's farm and mindlessly follow her orders, including the murder of her enemies. A mix of Haitian voodoo and undead ghoul, the zombies are nearly impossible to destroy. Eventually, a botched spell destroys the zombies and Luna is killed.  Roque and Pilar, who have come to respect each other, decide to work together to help the community.

'''''Maniac Cop III: Badge of Silence''''' is a 1993 action horror film written by Larry Cohen and directed by William Lustig, and an uncredited Joel Soisson. It is the third and final installment in the ''Maniac Cop'' series.
A priest practicing the Voodoo arts resurrects Matt Cordell (Robert Z'Dar), who takes his badge and comes back from the dead to do his bidding. Meanwhile, a pair of cameramen who are hoping to make it big come across a convenience store robbery, where a police officer named Katie Sullivan (Gretchen Becker) intervenes in a hostage situation; she manages to wound the suspect but realizes that the clerk is his girlfriend, and she had let him in purposefully to rob the store. There is a crossfire, and while Kate is severely wounded, she ends up killing the clerk in return. When rushed to the hospital, she is rendered comatose and brain dead, much to the chagrin of investigating officer Sean McKinney (Robert Davi). McKinney catches the report of Katie using excessive force in a hostage situation, which portrays the clerk as an innocent victim and threatens to free the badly injured Frank Jessup. Meanwhile, stalking Katie's progress, Cordell goes to the hospital to watch her. He kills one of her supervising physicians with defibrillator paddles, then exposes to high amounts of X-Ray radiation the physician set to sign the warrant to cut Kate's life support. The reporters who had framed Kate are then murdered, as well.
Meanwhile, McKinney and a physician, Susan (Caitlin Dulany), are investigating the murders and the strange behavior experienced by the comatose Kate. Their investigations lead them to Houngan (Julius Harris), who admits that he had brought Cordell back from the dead, and he is interested in Kate who is on the verge of death. At gunpoint, Cordell forces Houngan to attempt the resurrection on her, but he is unable to do so, stating her spirit is refusing to return from the dead to be with him. Cordell kills Houngan, and both he and Kate are set on fire in the process; she is wikt:immolate|immolated. As they escape, Susan and McKinney are chased by Cordell, who survived the fire while remaining ablaze. He chases them in a beat up police car, while they ride in an ambulance. They manage to throw an oxygen tank into the burning car before both crash. However, before Cordell can back up on the other disabled vehicle, the canister goes off, blowing up the car. Later, the charred corpse of Cordell is rolled into a morgue, next to the burned remains of Katie. While the lone coroner, who rolled Cordell into the morgue, is busy with his computer, the camera pans to the bodies, which shows Cordell's hand moving over to hold Katie's hand.

'''''Necropolis Awakened''''' is a 2002 American action-horror film written and directed by Garrett White.  It stars Duke White, Brandon White, and Garrett White in multiple roles.  An evil corporation bent on world domination begins their genetic experimentation in a small Oregon town, but they find unexpected resistance from an alcoholic veteran.
Skyhook, a small Oregon town, is chosen to be the new headquarters of Neo-Genentrix.  Nefarious Thorne, the genocidal CEO, unleashes a genetic experiment that converts most of the inhabitants of Skyhook into zombies.  Unsatisfied with anything less than complete domination, Thorne brings in assassins to hunt down the last remaining human, Bob, an alcoholic war hero and survivalist who was initially responsible for inviting Neo-Genentrix in Skyhook.  When Bob evades the mercenaries, Thorne himself tracks him down and captures him.  However, Bob is able to turn the tables on his captors and stop their plans for world domination.

''Necropolis Awakened'' was shot in Madras, Oregon over a period of 90 days, starting in May 2002.  Duke, the father of Brandon and Garrett, initially rejected the idea of a zombie film, as he felt the concept was played out.  Garrett was able to convince Duke that an action-horror hybrid film could be original.  Local residents volunteered as extras, and the sheriff's department allowed shooting at a newly built jail.  The Whites later worked more closely with the sheriff's department after someone mistakenly alerted the FBI about possible terrorist activity.
''Necropolis Awakened'' premiered in Madras, Oregon and received a limited theatrical release in December 2002.
Mike Watt of ''Film Threat'' rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that it is a likely cult film whose deficiencies "come with the indie territory."  In a mixed review, Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called it an "ambitious, flawed, and ultimately unsatisfying film."

The following is a '''list of zombie feature films'''. Zombies are fictional creatures usually portrayed as reanimated corpses or virally infected human beings. They are commonly portrayed as cannibalistic in nature. While zombie films generally fall into the horror genre, some cross over into other genres, such as comedy, science fiction, thriller, or romance. Distinct subgenres have evolved, such as the "zombie comedy" or the "zombie apocalypse". Zombies are distinct from ghosts, ghouls, mummies, or vampires, so this list does not include films devoted to these types of undead.
Victor Halperin's ''White Zombie'' was released in 1932 and is often cited as the first zombie film.

Reviews of the video were mixed. Beyondhollywood.com stated in its review, "[''Edges of Darkness'' is] not really anything above a B-level, straight-to-video product...Low budget films aren't usually known for their award-winning dialogue or fine acting, and ''Edges of Darkness'' conforms to the standard. The dialogue never feels "real," and the acting is pretty wooden. That said, I can see several of these actors advancing in their careers."

'''''Contracted''''' is a 2013 American horror film directed and written by Eric England. It was first released on November 23, 2013, in the United States and stars Najarra Townsend as a young woman that finds herself suffering from a mysterious sexually transmitted disease after a rape. It has been compared to the 2012 film ''Thanatomorphose'', with which it shares similarities. ''Twitch Film'' has criticized the movie for its marketing, in which England describes the character Samantha's rape as a "one night stand".
In a morgue, BJ has sex with a corpse that has a biohazard symbol on the toe tag; afterward, he handles an empty test tube while washing up.
Samantha is trying to get over a recent break-up with her girlfriend, Nikki. The party's host, Alice, plies her with strong drinks, while Zain offers her drugs. After she becomes heavily inebriated, Samantha is approached by BJ, who offers her a drink. Even though she tells him that she is a lesbian, when she begins to black out, BJ takes her to his car and rapes her. 
The next morning, Samantha thinks she is suffering from a bad hangover. She bickers with her mother, who struggles to accept her daughter's lesbianism and is worried that she might have relapsed into hard drug use. Alice tells Samantha that the police are searching for BJ, who Alice had never met. At the restaurant where she works, Samantha has trouble eating and is overly sensitive to noise. When she bleeds heavily from her vagina, she visits her doctor. Despite her protests that she is a lesbian who has not had sex with men for nearly a year, he is suspicious that she has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from heterosexual intercourse because of a rash that has developed in her groin.
Samantha tries to repair her relationship with Nikki, who is rude to her. Samantha is hurt to learn that Nikki had not let her know that a scholarship offer had come in the mail. Meanwhile, her symptoms continue to worsen. Her eyes turn bloodshot, her hair falls out in clumps. When she is called into the restaurant on a short-notice shift her fingernails begin to fall off. Samantha flees the restaurant and returns to her doctor, who advises her to avoid contact with other people until tests can determine the nature of her disease. Instead, Samantha visits Zain, who gives her heroin. When Alice arrives, she encourages Samantha to talk to the police about her encounter with BJ. Believing that Alice wants to isolate her from her other friends, Samantha argues with her and storms off. Zain reveals to Alice that he sold Rohypnol to BJ at the party.
Samantha stops off at home and argues violently with her mother. She abruptly leaves for her flower competition but is turned away at the door because of her appearance and the condition of her flowered plant.
Samantha turns to Nikki for consolation, but Nikki coldly rejects her and calls her sexually confused. Enraged, Samantha chokes Nikki to death. She then drives to Alice's in a rage and murders her by biting out her throat. Losing her sanity, Samantha invites Riley, a man who has had a crush on her, to Alice's house and tries to seduce him. Riley sees maggots fall out of Samantha's vagina and becomes repulsed. When he goes to the bathroom to inspect himself, he discovers Alice's body. Samantha flees the house. As she drives, she fades out of consciousness and is involved in a car crash. She emerges from the wreckage transformed fully into a zombie. Her mother, who has arrived at the scene, begs the police not to shoot Samantha. As the police caution Samantha against moving, she lunges at her screaming mother.

England said that he began working on ''Contracted'' due to his wanting to "tell a story within the virus/infection subgenre like we've never seen before" and that he wanted to use sex as a plot device as it was something that "most people can understand and relate to". Casting for the film was difficult due to the limited funds, as well as some actors finding the film's content "too bold" or having scheduling conflicts. Veteran horror actress Caroline Williams was cast as the mother of the main character after England and film producer Matt Mercer approached her via her Facebook page.
England had initially planned to have the film center around the film's protagonist experiencing the loss of her virginity, but changed it to focus on a character that is uncertain of her sexuality and has a prior lifestyle different than the one she currently has.
''Contracted'' at Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival on July 7, 2013.  IFC Films released it in the United States in theaters and video on demand on November 22, 2013,
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 53% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.8/10.
Ben Croll of Twitch Film criticized the film's marketing, which depicts a one-night stand that is opposed by an unambiguous depiction of rape in the film. However, Croll states that the major themes of the film are denial and self-deception, which color Samantha's own perception of the incident. ''
A sequel titled  ''Contracted: Phase II'' was released September 4, 2015, in the US.

'''''The Dead Matter''''' is 2010 American feature-length horror film by filmmakers Edward Douglas of Midnight Syndicate, Gary Jones, and Robert Kurtzman.
Gretchen (Sean Serino), a young woman, becomes desperate to contact her brother after his passing. She discovers an amulet that allows her to control the dead-which she uses to try and contact him. The amulet also allows results in the calling forth of a small army of zombies, comedically called "Post-Mortem Americans" in the film. This amulet is a sought after relic, pursued by two feuding vampires who have been at odds for millennia: Vellich (Andrew Divoff) and Sebed (Tom Savini). After encountering the vampires, Gretchen and her friends are joined by the vampire-hunter McCallister (Jason Carter), who had originally stolen the amulet from Vellich. McCallister helps Gretchen and her friends combat the villains, and the film ends with a final showdown between the protagonists and the vampires.
The film's premise was derived from a student short film shot in 1996 for $2000 at John Carroll University. Filming on the professional release version began in the summer of 2007 at the abandoned Mansfield Reformatory in northeastern Ohio-the same location as the film ''The Shawshank Redemption''. The production budget for the film was about $1.5 million, raised from investors in the State of Ohio. Edward Douglas directed the film, which was produced by Robert Kurtzman's company Precinct 13 Entertainment. A rough version was screen-tested in early 2008 before the film was sent to editing. ''The Dead Matter'' is the largest film ever to be funded and filmed entirely in northeastern Ohio. The majority of the cast and crew were also from Ohio themselves, including the cast, a crew of seventy people, and about three dozen extras playing the role of zombies.
During the lead-up to the film's release, the Midnight Syndicate named their 2008 album ''The Dead Matter: Cemetery Gates'' as a marketing technique. The final soundtrack, composed by Edward Douglas, was released in 2010 as ''The Dead Matter: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''.
The official premiere of the film occurred at the Tower City Cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio on October 3, 2009.
''Killer Reviews'' wrote of the film that, "Its production values are good enough to keep us involved and the film knows well enough not to take itself too seriously which only adds to the enjoyment factor," and mentioned the film's "clever dialogue". ''Movie Crypt'' wrote that the film was "a script that is clearly from a horror fan writing for horror fans". ''Fearnet'' wrote that "The Dead Matter is an ambitious effort for a first-time filmmaker, but I'd say Douglas and company managed to accomplish their goal of transforming Midnight Syndicate's sense of spooky Halloween fun to a visual medium. The writing is economical, and seldom bogs down with talky exposition; the plot is revealed in stages, and it's only baffling when it's intended to be."

'''''My Fair Zombie''''' is a Canadian comedy-musical horror film written by Trevor Payer and directed by Brett Kelly. It was produced by Anne-Marie Frigon.

During a zombie outbreak in Ireland, an American documentary film crew become interested in the story of a local Irish family who decide to keep their zombie-turned son a part of the family.

The film was originally more of a genre film, but budget constraints meant that director Bing Bailey needed to turn it into a hybrid of mockumentary and genre film.  Bailey said that he wanted to "have his ''Evil Dead'' experience".  Pre-production was done over the Internet, as Bailey was living in the United States at the time.  Shooting took place in October 2009, May 2010, and May 2011; the additional shoots were due to a revamp of the initial concept that involved abandoned man-on-the-street interviews.  Post-production took another 18 months.
''Portrait of a Zombie'' premiered at the 2012 Cinequest Film Festival.
Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News called it "a mix of comedy, gore, drama, and action that works in ways few others have."

When they arrive, Robert's ex-girlfriend, Marlene, confronts him and demands to know why he dumped her and left town.  As Robert and Marlene talk, Eugen and Patrick flirt with Marlene's friend, Vanessa.  Patrick invites the women to a party later that night despite Robert's protestations.  Later, the trio are harassed in turn by Bollman, the town bully, and Lieutenant Lehmann, an unfriendly cop.  When they finally arrive at Professor Bergen's mansion, they discover the place is in near ruins.  Robert gives his friends free rein, and they raid the wine cellar.
When the women arrive at the mansion, Robert and Marlene reconcile.  Vanessa and Patrick continue their flirting, and leave the others to have sex.  Eugen, drunk on absinthe and depressed, attempts to commit suicide, but Robert stops him.  Bollman, who has been using roadkill in his local fast food delivery service, becomes infected with the mutated virus.  Bollman develops large boils, becomes increasingly savage and animalistic, and goes on a violent rampage at Professor Bergen's mansion that culminates in his biting Patrick.  Patrick immediately falls ill, and Eugen taunts him with grim medical diagnoses, such as amputation.  Bollman, thought dead after the struggle, suddenly reappears and resumes his attacks.  Robert is forced to shoot him dead with a pistol.  Shaken, Robert volunteers to seek help, and Marlene joins him.  Eugen and Vanessa burn Bollman's body and watch over Patrick, though Eugen secretly continues his taunts and threatens to kill Patrick.  When Robert and Marlene see Lieutenant Lehmann murder and attempt to cannibalize a local, they retreat back to the mansion.
Robert and Marlene, who is a biology student, use Professor Bergen's lab to analyze the virus.  Robert urges Eugen to help, but Eugen dismisses their research as pointless and outright advocates killing Patrick.  When the semiconscious Patrick saves them from a stray villager who has entered the mansion, the others refuse to kill him; instead, they bind him upstairs and continue their research.  Eugen angrily leaves when Robert suggests that he, too, is infected, and Vanessa flees into the nearby woods.  As Eugen is in the process of turning, he helps Vanessa defeat several infected villagers, but he turns hostile.  In a moment of clarity, he commits suicide.  Robert and Marlene flee to the top of the mansion, where they realize there's no escape but to jump.  Robert survives the fall, but Marlene does not.  As dawn breaks, soldiers storm the property, kill the infected townspeople, and take Robert in for testing.  Convinced that Robert is uninfected, a rival scientist to Professor Bergen confidently asserts that they will have the situation under control soon, but Robert disputes that the virus can be stopped.

'''''The Returned''''' () is a 2013 Spanish-Canadian thriller film directed by Manuel Carballo, written by Hatem Khraiche, and starring Emily Hampshire, Kris Holden-Ried, Shawn Doyle, and Claudia Bassols.  When a rare and difficult to obtain medicine that requires daily doses to stave off the effects of a zombie infection runs low, a physician (Hampshire) and her infected husband (Holden-Ried) go on the run to avoid angry demonstrators.
In the 1980s, a zombie plague spreads worldwide and causes the deaths of an estimated 100 million people.  An unprecedented amount of research goes into finding a cure, but the resulting medicine requires daily doses to be effective.  If the infected miss even a single dose, they quickly and irrevocably degenerate to a feral zombie state.  As the formula can only be extracted from dead feral zombies, there are constant rumors that the supplies will run out.  Infected humans, called "the returned", are subject to discrimination and violence from bigoted and fearful uninfected humans.
Kate, a physician who cares for the returned and fundraises to support research to develop a synthetic medicine, has been stocking up on black market doses of the treatment, fearful that it will run out soon.  Her husband Alex, a music teacher, became infected when he attempted to assist a man who he thought was having a seizure.  Alex comes out as returned to his best friend Jacob, who readily accepts him.  When protestors become violent, and the government begins to set up quarantine camps, Jacob and his wife Amber invite Alex and Kate to stay with them outside the city.  Alex narrowly avoids both an attempted murder and police searches.
When Kate's source turns up dead, and evidence points toward Amber, Kate instructs Alex to check on their supply of the treatment.  Alex finds a single dose and a note from Jacob that apologizes for taking the rest, as Amber has become infected.  With only one day left to live as a human, Alex becomes desperate to find a new source.  Kate returns to the city and reveals her dilemma to the hospital chief, who gives her the hospital's entire stash.  However, the parent of an infected child attempts to steal the container, and in the ensuing fight over it, all the contents are destroyed.
Distraught, Kate returns empty-handed and comforts Alex, who has chained himself to the wall. Alex slowly experiences the symptoms of the change and demands that Kate shoot him in the head. Kate, who had a traumatic experience in her past, when her mother became infected, is reluctant to oblige him, but she kills him off-screen once he turns. As Kate returns to the city to settle her affairs, the hospital chief excitedly tells her that researchers have created a synthesized treatment. Kate falls to her knees in grief.
In the final scene, some months later, a pregnant Kate prepares to assassinate Jacob and Amber at a book tour.

'''''Slither''''' is a 2006 American science fiction-comedy horror film written and directed by James Gunn in his directoral debut, and starring Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, Gregg Henry, and Michael Rooker. The film was produced by Paul Brooks and Eric Newman. The film has similar themes and concepts as the 1986 B-movie ''Night of the Creeps''.
''Slither'' was a box office bomb which received generally positive reviews from critics and has since become a cult film.
A meteorite housing a malevolent, sentient extraterrestrial parasite crashes into the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina. While frolicking in the woods with Brenda, local car dealer Grant finds the parasite and is infected by it. The parasite takes over his body and absorbs his consciousness and memories. With the alien now in control of his body, "Grant" begins to slowly change into a tentacled, slug-like monster.
Many pets soon disappear, but Grant is not suspected. However, his wife Starla begins to question his health; he explains the initial changes in his appearance as an allergic reaction to a bee sting, saying that a doctor has already given him something for it, but Starla soon learns this is a lie. Starla contacts the police chief Bill Pardy - her childhood crush - who attempts to reassure and comfort her while not acting on his feelings.
Grant infects the lonely and neglected Brenda with hundreds of his offspring. He hides her in an isolated barn where she becomes massively obese as baby alien slugs grow inside her. Bill leads a small group of officers on a hunt for Grant; they find Brenda in time to see her explode, releasing hundreds of the alien slugs. Most of Bill's group are infected by the slugs and become Grant's puppets, speaking as if they were Grant and obsessed with bringing Starla home and holding her to her wedding vows.
Everyone in town is quickly eaten by others infected with Grant's offspring, or absorbed into Grant's hive mind except Starla, Bill, mayor Jack MacReady, and a teenage girl, Kylie, who had escaped from her family that were also infected by the parasites. She tells them of how she saw the slug's memories; it moves from planet to planet, eating or absorbing all life it finds there. The parasite's consciousness, however, is influenced by the real Grant's memories and his love for his wife, Starla.
The survivors try to escape detection and kill Grant. The townspeople attack their vehicle, capturing Starla and Jack. Bill and Kylie track Starla to her home, and find that the infected are melding into one giant creature. They must risk their lives to stop the infestation from spreading any further. Jack awakens in the house's basement, where several of the infected are eating; he tries to escape but becomes infected by Grant as he reaches the top of the stairs and opens the door. Starla charms the monster by calling him "Grant" and telling him they can be together, but as they get close to each other, she pulls a hairbrush handle from her underwear and stabs him in the chest with the pointed handle. He slaps her with a tentacle and knocks her across the room.
Bill arrives; Jack begs to be killed, and Bill shoots him in the head. He tries to kill the monster with a grenade, but another tentacle knocks the grenade into the pool, where it detonates. The monster sends two tentacles to stab Bill and infect him the same way he infected Brenda; one is lodged in his abdomen, but Bill attaches the other to a small propane tank, filling Grant with gas, and Starla shoots the monster, causing it to explode, whereupon all the infected die. The three survivors walk away to find a hospital for Bill.
In a post-credits scene, a cat approaches to feed off Grant's remains and is infected.

Controversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with Fred Dekker's 1986 horror-comedy ''Night of the Creeps''. According to journalist Steve Palopoli:
Palopoli then goes on to directly compare ''Slither'' to the aforementioned ''Creeps'' as well as Shivers (film)|''Shivers'' (1975). Gunn has stated that both Cronenberg's ''Shivers'' and his 1979 film ''The Brood'' were the two biggest influences on the story in ''Slither,'' along with the 2000 manga ''Uzumaki'' by Junji Ito. ''Slither'' also pays homage to the studio Troma Films, where Gunn began his career. Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufman has a cameo as a "Sad Drunk", and one scene includes a clip from the Troma film, ''The Toxic Avenger''.
In one scene, the bodies of mutilated dogs are discovered on "the Castevet's farm".  Minnie and Roman Castevet were the Satan-worshiping next-door neighbors in "Rosemary's Baby" (1968).
''Slither'' was released on regular DVD and on HD DVD/DVD hybrid disc on October 24, 2006.
''Slither'' received generally positive reviews. The film-review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 86% of critics gave a favorable review; the consensus states: "A slimy, rotten B-movie homage oozing with affection for low-budget horror films, ''Slither'' is a tale of creepy crawly little beasts that invade Smalltown, USA. Equally creepy and funny, critics say it's one of the most enjoyable of its type in years -- if you've got the stomach for this sort of thing. ''Slither'' is a wicked good time: it'll make you squirm -- when you're not busting a gut laughing." The movie was also featured in the April 14, 2006 issue of ''Entertainment Weekly'' as #1 on "The Must List"; "Ten Things We Love This Week".
Among the critics who did not like the film, Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave ''Slither'' a "two thumbs down" rating on their television show, with Roeper saying he was "all zombied out" after reviewing a wave of zombie-themed films from the year before.. Ebert & Roeper, from movies.com. Guest critic Michael Phillips named ''Slither'' his DVD pick of the week on the television show ''At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper''. ''Slither'' was listed as one of the "Top 25 DVDs of the Year" by Peter Travers in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.
''Slither'' was "a box office flop", Its box office performance was substantially less than its total budget of $29.5 million, including marketing costs; the production budget taking up about $15 million of the total.
Paul Brooks, president of the film's production company, Gold Circle Films, said the company was "crushingly disappointed" by the gross. Universal distanced itself from ''Slither''s performance "might have killed off the horror-comedy genre for the near future." Producer Paul Brooks offered this explanation about why ''Slither'' failed to catch on with filmgoers:

'''''Zombibi''''' (also released as '''''Zombie Kill!''''') is a 2012 Dutch splatter comedy film directed by Martijn Smits and Erwin van den Eshof, written by Tijs van Marle, and starring Yahya Gaier, Gigi Ravelli, Mimoun Ouled Radi, Sergio Hasselbaink, Uriah Arnhem, and Noel Deelen as survivors of a zombie attack in Amsterdam-West.
Aziz works in an Amsterdam office building.  He dislikes his job and his boss, but he has just begun dating his dream girl, Tess.  Jealous of his success with Tess, his boss uses the constant phone calls by Aziz's brother Mo as an excuse to fire him.  Annoyed but having nowhere else to go, Aziz joins Mo at the pool party to which Mo has invited him, only to become an unwilling participant in a fight instigated by Mo's carelessness.  Mo and Aziz end up jailed with Jeffrey and Nolan, incompetent bouncers at the party, and Joris, a thief.  All but Aziz hit on Kim, a tough cop, and she tasers both Mo and Jeffrey after they talk back to her.  Later, alarms go off and the building loses power.  Mo initially dismisses this as theatrics intended to scare them, but when the doors to their cells open, the group discovers the police station in ruins.  Curious, they leave the station, and zombies attack them; Kim saves them, and they return to the station. 
Television broadcasts reveal that a Russian space probe, contaminated with a green slime, has caused the residents of Amsterdam-West to turn into zombies.  Aziz becomes worried when he sees that the probe crashed into his office building, and when he receives a call for help from Tess, he insists that they go there to rescue her.  The others refuse and instead suggest that they go to a designated shelter.  After they loot a sporting goods store for equipment, Aziz sets off on his own to rescue Tess, and Kim reluctantly accompanies him, equally impressed and annoyed with his dedication to Tess.  They do not get far before they are swamped by zombies, and they rejoin the rest of the group, who have accidentally killed Ben Saunders.  The group retreats to a chop shop, where the mechanics demonstrate that the green slime is an energy source.  When the mechanics turn into zombies, the group splits up: Aziz and Kim set off to rescue Tess, and Joris convinces the others to rob a bank.
Joris doublecrosses the others and leaves with the money, and a zombie bites Nolan.  When Nolan begins vomiting green slime, he requests they kill him; after several unsuccessful attempts to bludgeon Nolan to death, they abandon him.  Both Mo and Tess call Aziz and ask for help.  Caught between his brother and his girlfriend, Aziz decides to first help his brother.  Kim and Aziz rescue Jeffrey and Mo, but they end up stranded at a playground.  They are rescued by the Barachi brothers, who, in a video game sequence, defeat the zombies and then leave.  When the group arrives at the shelter, soldiers refuse to assist Aziz in rescuing Tess, and he steals a truck.  The others join him, and they set off for the office building.  Jeffrey, now armed with a minigun, holds off the zombie hordes while Aziz, Mo, and Kim work their way up the building, only to find out that Tess was already rescued by a former lover. 
Furious at the pointlessness, Kim leaves on her own and randomly encounters Tess, who has now transformed into a zombie.  At the same time, Aziz and Mo reach the building's roof, where a Russian commando explains his plan to blow up the building.  Before he can, he is bitten, turns into a zombie, and bites Mo, who decides to stay behind and use the detonator.  Aziz finds Kim just as she beheads Tess, and Aziz hurredly explains about the explosives.  Jeffrey, who has climbed the entire building while toting his minigun, follows them back down the staircase.  As zombies swarm Mo, he triggers the explosives, and the building collapses; Aziz, Kim, and Jeffrey escape with the help of the Barachi brothers.  When they triumphantly return to the shelter, they see the soldiers suck the blood from survivors.  Aziz says that he hates vampires, and they prepare for another fight.
''Zombibi'' was released on 16 February 2012 in the Netherlands, where it grossed $302,777.
Paul Mount of ''Starburst'' rated it 7/10 stars and called it "delightfully daffy fun".  Adam Tyner of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, "''Kill Zombie!'' tries to mimic Wright's motions as best it can but never approaches anything close to those same heights."  Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict wrote that it "has some decent laughs" but "retreads what other filmmakers have done".

'''''Dead Within''''' is a 2014 American thriller film directed by Ben Wagner and written by Matthew Bradford, Dean Chekvala, Amy Kale Peterson, and Wagner.  It stars Dean Chekvala and Amy Kale Peterson as a couple that survives a Zombie#Zombie_apocalypse|zombie apocalypse by hiding out in a cabin in the woods.  Mike (Chekvala) periodically leaves the cabin to search for food and supplies, leaving Kim (Peterson) alone with her thoughts and paranoia.
After a Zombie#Zombie_apocalypse|zombie apocalypse, Mike and Kim reinforce their cabin in the woods.  Whenever their supplies run out, Mike leaves to scavenge.  Though Kim wishes to come with him, he insists that she stay behind in the cabin, where she is safe.  Mike, who keeps a running tally of the zombies that he destroys, uses a rhythmic series of knocks based on classic rock songs in order to identify himself and prove that he has not become infected.  Symptoms of infection include black irises, black blood, and violent paranoia.  As the supplies in the area become exhausted, Mike suggests that they return to hunting for their food.  Kim refuses, and flashbacks reveal that a second couple, Todd and Erika, lived with them until Todd and Erika ate tainted meat.  Mike and Kim are forced to kill both the couple and their own baby, who also ate the tainted food.
While Mike is out on a scavenging trip, Kim receives a call on her walkie-talkie from a man identifying himself as Ranger Mark.  Mark is at first helpful and promises to aid her, but his calls become more abusive and misogynistic over time.  Kim does not tell Mike about the calls.  After an unproductive outing, Mike says that the area has become too dangerous for the meager supplies that he is able to find, and he proposes that they move to the coast, where they can live in a mansion and safely run a generator.  Kim agrees and asks to accompany Mike, but he again refuses.  Kim is left alone for a longer period this time, as Mike must locate enough resources to last them the entire trip.  While he is gone, she experiences a series of nightmares and hallucinations, including hauntings by Erika and her baby, Ranger Mark's taunting her over their deaths, and paintings that seemingly come to life.
When Mike finally returns, he gets the coded knock incorrect.  After Kim sees blood and cuts on him, she becomes suspicious and does not allow him entry.  Mike insists that he is not infected and demands to be let inside, but Kim only becomes more distrustful and resentful of his past behavior.  Desperate for shelter, Mike attempts to break into the cabin, and Kim cuts off several of his fingers.  When Mike recovers, he finds that she has tied him to a chair and is debating what to do with him.  Kim becomes convinced that Mike is infected despite his protestations, and she kills him.  Excited that she may now leave the cabin, she dances in the yard.  Mike's reanimated corpse attacks her, and she kills him once again.  In the last shot, her irises and blood are revealed to have turned pitch black.

After its world premiere at London FrightFest Film Festival, the film was acquired by Millennium Entertainment in June 2014.
Anton Bitel of Grolsh Film Works described ''Dead Within'' as "a sharply nuanced survivor's tale that leaves the viewer to disentangle the genre tropes from their underlying triggers, and the reality from its delirious breakdown."  Jeremy Blitz of DVD Talk wrote, "It's not totally successful, but definitely worth a watch."

'''''The Return of the Living Dead''''' is a 1985 American horror comedy film written and directed by Dan O'Bannon, and starring Clu Gulager, James Karen, and Don Calfa. The film tells the story of how a warehouse owner accompanied by his two employees, mortician friend, and a group of teenage punks deal with the accidental release of a horde of brain-hungry zombies onto an unsuspecting town.
The film is known for introducing the popular concept of zombies eating brains, as opposed to just eating human flesh, like previous zombie iterations, as well as its soundtrack, which features several noted deathrock and punk rock bands of the era. The film was a critical success and performed moderately well at the box office. Its enduring popularity has spawned four sequels and turned it into a cult classic.
At a medical supply warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky, a foreman named Frank tries to impress the company's newest employee Freddy by showing him military drums that accidentally wound up in the basement of the building; the drum contains the remains of a military experiment gone wrong that inspired the film ''Night of the Living Dead.'' Frank accidentally unleashes the toxic gas, which renders the two unconscious. When waking up, Frank and Freddy find that the gas reanimated a cadaver inside a meat locker, and contact their boss and warehouse owner Burt Wilson to help them deal with the situation. When decapitation cannot kill the cadaver, Burt decides to bring the corpse to the nearby mortuary to have its dismembered parts burned in a gambit to destroy it once and for all.
Meanwhile, Freddy's friends learn of his new job from his girlfriend Tina. The group, consisting of Spider, Trash, Scuz, Suicide, Casey, and Chuck, decide to pick Freddy up after he finishes his shift and wait inside the local cemetery. Tina leaves the graveyard and enters the warehouse to look for Freddy. Her search leads her to the basement, where she unwittingly draws attention from the half-melted corpse from the drum barrel (dubbed "Tarman") who was initially thought to have dissolved. She locks herself inside a metal closet after a failed attempt to run, but the zombie finds a chained hook and tries to pull the door off. 
At the mortuary, Burt gets the mortician Ernie to burn the remains, not realizing that it causes the gas to contaminate the air and bringing a toxic rainfall to resurrect the dead in the graveyard. The acid rain forces Freddy's friends to refuge inside the warehouse. Once inside, the group hears the basement commotion and immediately rush down to rescue Tina, but Suicide is bitten by Tarman in the process. This forces the group, including Tina, to abandon Suicide and barricade the door to stop Tarman from coming up. Outside, the group runs through the cemetery to look for Freddy, but are split up when the zombies begin rising from their graves. While the group is running Trash gets surrounded by and eaten by zombies, ironically dying the way she described earlier as the worst way to die. Tina, Spider, and Scuz go to the mortuary, Chuck and Casey head back to the warehouse where Tarman remains trapped downstairs.
Frank and Freddy have grown increasingly ill from their exposure to the gas and a medical test from paramedics implies that they are no longer alive. When Burt and Ernie find out about the graveyard zombies, they quickly barricade the mortuary after a failed attempt to escape using the ambulance. Scuz is killed while protecting the barricade and the zombies continue to eat the paramedics and police who arrive in the area. With Frank and Freddy showing signs of becoming zombies themselves, Burt has them locked in the chapel and Tina stays with Freddy. Meanwhile, Trash rises as a zombie and starts a semi-organized horde that attacks the reinforcements head-on. 
Freddy succumbs as zombie and tries to eat Tina, but is blinded with acid thrown by Ernie. Frank also escapes and cremates himself inside the retort. Burt and Spider use a police car outside to escape, but the growing horde of zombies leaves them unable to come back for Ernie and Tina. They retreat to the warehouse and the car explodes due to a gasoline leak. Burt and Spider reunite with Casey and Chuck, and go to the basement's phone after Burt knocks off Tarman's head with a baseball bat. With the police massacred by the zombies, Burt decides to call the military drum's number. The call goes to Colonel Glover, a military officer looking for the barrels. When Glover learns that the gas has been released, he activates a containment protocol with a nuclear artillery shell to destroy the area. Just as a blinded Freddy breaks into an attic where Ernie and Tina are hiding, the shell destroys 20 square blocks of Louisville and ultimately kills both the survivors and zombies. With footage shown of the destroyed area, Glover describes the outcome with less than 4,000 dead and dismisses reports of the acid rain, which soon restarts the zombie rising all over again.

The film has its roots in a novel by John A. Russo|John Russo also called ''Return of the Living Dead''. When Russo and George A. Romero parted ways after their 1968 film ''Night of the Living Dead'', Russo retained the rights to any titles featuring ''Living Dead'' while Romero was free to create his own series of sequels, beginning with ''Dawn of the Dead''. Russo and producer Tom Fox planned to bring ''Return of the Living Dead'' to the screen in 3D and directed by Tobe Hooper. Dan O'Bannon was brought in to give the script a polish and after Hooper backed out to make ''Lifeforce'' (also from a script by Dan O'Bannon), O'Bannon was offered the director's seat. He accepted on the condition he could rewrite the film radically so as to differentiate it from Romero's films. Russo retains a story writer credit on the film for developing the project, but the final film bears little to no resemblance to his original novel. He later wrote a novelization of the film which was fairly faithful to the shooting script, though without the character names as in the final film and the addition of a KGB subplot as an explanation for the plot. (Russo would, eventually, make his own 'canon' series with a 1998 revised edition of ''Night of the Living Dead'', subtitled the ''30th Anniversary Edition'', and its sequel, ''Children of the Living Dead''.)
O'Bannon's script also differed from the Romero series in that it was markedly more comical than Romero's films, employing "splatstick" style morbid humor and eccentric dialogue. The films also boasted significant nudity, in marked contrast to Romero's work. Russo and O'Bannon were only directly involved with the first film in the series. The rest of the films, to varying degrees, stick to their outline and "rules" established in the first film.
Although the movie is set in Louisville, Kentucky, it was filmed in California. The Louisville police uniforms and patrol cars were all period correct.
The "Tarman" zombie is performed by actor and puppeteer Allan Trautman, who is best known for his work with Jim Henson and The Muppets.
The "Half-Corpse" zombie character was an animatronic puppet created by Tony Gardner and puppeteered by Gardner, actor Brian Peck ("Scuz"), and Production Designer William Stout. This character launched Tony Gardner's career as an independent makeup effects artist.
The characters of Burt Wilson and Ernie Kaltenbrunner are, contrary to popular belief, not named after the characters from ''Sesame Street''; Dan O'Bannon had no idea he was using the names of those characters.
Originally, Frank was supposed to be completely transformed into a zombie and join the zombie mob, but James Karen did not wish to film any scenes in the cold rain of Los Angeles, so he instead suggested that Frank immolate himself before said transformation could be completed. O'Bannon agreed to the suggestion.
''The Return of the Living Dead'' was a critical and a moderate box office success. It currently holds a 91% approval rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes,
Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing that the film is "kind of a sensation-machine, made out of the usual ingredients, and the real question is whether it's done with style. It is." Stephen Holden of ''The New York Times'' called the film a "mordant punk comedy", stating that it "is by no means the ultimate horror movie it aspires to be".

The film was originally released on DVD in the UK by Tartan Home Video on March 19, 2001. Up until 2012, this was the only time it had been issued in its original form. On August 27, 2002, MGM released a Special Edition DVD in the US with a new cut of the movie (with music alterations due to copyright issues) with a commentary by O'Bannon and a documentary on the making of the film. The cover of the DVD case for the 2002 release glows in the dark. On September 11, 2007, a Special edition|Collector's Edition of the film was released with additional extra features involving the cast. The different home video releases have featured different soundtracks, often changing the songs used. Also, the basement zombie's ("Tar-Man") voice was altered. Originally, the zombie had a higher, raspier voice.
A 25th anniversary edition was released on September 14, 2010, exclusively for Blu-ray Disc. The Blu-ray Disc version is a 2-disc combo pack with both a Blu-ray Disc and DVD. This release is very similar to the MGM/Fox print from 3 years earlier.
On June 4, 2012, Second Sight Films out of U.K. released DVD and Blu-ray Disc versions of the film where the original audio and soundtrack in its original form can be selected, the first time since 2001 a release has had this option. The release had its first insight into the movie with the inclusion on a booklet (claimed to be based on Ernie's notes from the events of the film) which was edited from Gary Smart and Christian Seller's publication ''The Complete History of The Return of the Living Dead''.
Scream Factory released a 30th anniversary Collector's Edition Blu-Ray on July 19, 2016. MGM also released another edition with hand-drawn cover art.
''Return of the Living Dead'' popularized the notion in the public conscious of zombies eating specifically brains (as opposed to simply flesh) and that zombies groan "Braaiinnsss!" as they walk. In a critical scene in the movie, a zombie (presumably female) who has killed one of the characters is tied to a table (she exists only as a half-torso) and explains that the dead seek brains because eating brains "makes the pain go away--the pain of being dead". It is a popular misconception that George Romero invented this specific trait as part of his ''Night of the Living Dead'' series, though he has emphasised that it was not his idea.
*Clu Gulager's character, Burt Wilson, sports a "Members Only" jacket while fighting off zombies.  This brand was popular during the 1980s.
* The film was spoofed in an episode of ''South Park'' called "Pink Eye" where Kenny catches the eponymous infection and everyone becomes brain-eating zombies. The film's zombie cries of "Brains...more brains" were parodied in the ''South Park'' episode "Night of the Living Homeless" where the town is overrun by homeless people who repeatedly ask for "change".
*In the tenth episode of ''The Simpsons''' eleventh season ("Little Big Mom"), Bart and Homer believe they have leprosy and begin to act like zombies.  When trying to ask Ned Flanders for help, they reach through the mail slot on his front door, saying, in a zombie-like voice, "Brains. Brains." Then Homer cheerfully says, "Use your brains to help us." Then, using the zombie-like voice again, he says, "Your delicious brains."
* In 2011, ''Return of the Living Dead (film series)#More Brains! A Return of the Living Dead Documentary|More Brains! A Return of the Living Dead Documentary'' was released on DVD.
A book titled ''The Complete History of the Return of the Living Dead'' was released October 2010. The book covered all five movies in the series. It featured interviews from over 70 members of the cast and crew, as well as 150 never-before-published filmmakers photos, film stills and posters.

'''Dawn of the Mummy''' is a 1981 horror film directed by Frank Agrama, who also served as writer and producer on the film. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic.
In ancient Egypt during the fourth millennium BC, slave raiders abduct several villagers to be servants for the burial of Pharaoh Sefirama. They were then ordered to stand around the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, killed with poison gas, and the entrance to his tomb was sealed. The high priestess (Laila Nasr) who attended the burial proclaims that "he who enters this tomb, after it is sealed, will die on the dawn of the mummy".
Thousands of years later into the present day, three men, Rick (Barry Sattels), Tariq (Ali Gohar), and Karib (Ibrahim Khan) detonate the tomb and uncover its entrance. Rick warns the other two to wait until the next morning, as the air around the uncovered tomb is poisoned. The high priestess, now an elderly woman, screams and tells them that the tomb is cursed, but is scared off when Rick shoots his pistol at the air. Rick tells them to guard the tomb for the night, and drives away on his Jeep.
Three grave robbers on camels were greeted by the old woman, who tells them to close the tomb to prevent its curse. They ask her and enter the tomb, but get infected by its poisonous gases. One of them dies, while the other two leave.
A photographer and a group of American models travel to Egypt for a fashion shoot. On the way to the tomb, a tire on one of their Jeeps gets punctured, so the group has to stop to replace the tire. One of the models, Lisa (Brenda Siemer Schieder) asks the director, Gary (John Salvo), to look at the other side of a dune. They race to the bottom of the other side, but Lisa falls and gets scared by one of the grave robbers' heads lying on the sand. The rest of their group takes them back to their location.
Rick and his detonate the tomb, and explore its burial chamber, though Rick's henchmen were disappointed that there is no gold. Ahamed Zaiki (Ahmad Labab) arrives to check on his investments in the excavations, and after Rick's assurances, he leaves. On the next morning, Rick attempts to chisel a passage into the chamber, but Tarak and Karib detonate its entrance with more dynamite. Even though they were disappointed again by the chamber's lack of gold, they open Sefirama's sarcophagus to look for more treasures. A mouse jumps unto Karib's back, and frightens him.
After settling near a riverbank village for the night, the American models' group moves on next morning to shoot photos near the tomb. Karib shoots his gun at them, thinking that they are intruders, but Rick and Tarak stop him. The models' group proceeds on to the tomb, against Rick and his henchmen's objections. While doing so, their hot lights accidentally revive Pharaoh Seferman's mummy. Rick snaps off the cable on one of their spotlights. Jenny is asked to go and find a battery for their spotlights, but she spills a bowl containing one of the Pharaoh's organs, infecting her hand and frightening her. Their hot lights accidentally revive Pharaoh Seferman's mummy and his followers, a band of flesh-eating zombies.
Tariq is left to return to his home in a city, while Jenny's hand infection persists and burns her. Karib enters the tomb alone by himself, cuts open Pharaoh Sefirama's mummy, and steals his crook and flail. A door to another chamber opens. Karib enters, but is incapacitated by the door, and dragged away.
In the next morning, Rick and Tariq enter the tomb as they search for Karib, and are overjoyed to find Pharaoh Sefirama's crook and flail, and other treasures. The models and their team return for another photo shoot, but their continued usage of lighting has awakened the Pharaoh.

''Dawn of the Mummy'' was filmed in Egypt
Unlike traditional  interpretations of mummies in cinema, the film's portrayal of the undead is quite unique. In the film the mummies are portrayed as ravenous flesh eaters, similar to the popular portrayal of zombies in which both share many similarities.
Due to the film's surprisingly graphic content the film was subject to several cuts in the UK in order to trim down the film's more graphic scenes, approximately 1 minute and 43 seconds were cut from the film from 12 different scenes in the film. Some scenes included The Mummy ramming a machete into the character Tarak's head, a man being gutted by the mummy, and scenes where the mummy's undead servants feast on several characters.
''Dawn of the Mummy'' has been released on VHS and DVD format.  The film was released on region 1 by Madacy Entertainment, as a VHS transfer.  The packaging is said to list the film's Theatrical Trailer and other Theatrical Trailers, although there is only one on the disc, it is not for the main feature, it is of a 1997 film, ''Road Ends''.  It does however feature an audio commentary track by director Frank Agrama. Brian Lindsey
The film was released uncut in the UK by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It features an anamorphic widescreen Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|1.77:1 transfer, plus the Aspect ratio (image)#4:3|4:3 full screen transfer, DTS Digital Surround, Dolby Digital 2.0 & 5.1 Surround. The extras include Director's Audio Commentary, Stills Gallery, Production Notes and Trailer.
The film has received mixed to negative reviews from critics.
John Stanley awarded the film 2 / 4 stars stating, "''Hashish smokers in a Cairo square are as exciting as it gets in this tale''".
''Popcorn Pictures.com'' gave the film 6/10 stating, "It is an arduous struggle to get past the first half of Dawn of the Mummy but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with one of the more entertaining zombie flicks of its period: a guilty pleasure of trashy exploitation at its finest. If the entire film had been as enjoyable as the last half, you'd be looking at a bonafide classic right here".
It was awarded a score of 0 / 4 by ''VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever'' which panned the film's plot and acting.
Anthony Hickox wrote 2012 the script of the remake Prisoners of the Sun, which directed by Roger Christian and stars Joss Ackland, Carmen Chaplin, Nick Moran and John Rhys-Davies.

'''''Germ Z''''', also billed as '''''Germ''''', is a 2013 American horror film.  It depicts the residents of a small town who become infected with a bacterium that has fallen to Earth from space.  It was produced by Two Thirds Productions.
The film opens with a man in a medical containment suit running through the forest.  He is chased by another man who is covered in blood and screaming.  The man in the hazard suit falls and hides behind a log, watching as the bloodied man clutches his head before the back of his skull explodes.
The movie then tracks back forty hours earlier, showing a woman named Brooke jogging in the woods.  She is joined by local deputy Max, and the two make love in the woods.  Elsewhere, a small group of military men set up a mobile missile launcher on the side of a hill.  The men have been tasked with shooting down an orbiting satellite with a missile.  As the missile is launched, the satellite is struck by a meteorite and explodes, with the meteorite continuing on and striking the Earth.
Brooke returns home and meets with her parents, while Max heads back to the sheriff's office.  There he learns from fellow deputy Davidson that the meteorite has caused a brush fire.  Davidson tells him that the military advised them to avoid the area due to possible chemical contamination, but the fire department is dispatched to dig fire breaks and contain the area.  One of the firefighters discovers a piece of satellite wreckage with an odd green ooze attached to it and picks it up; later he is shown becoming ill.
That evening Brooke's friend Karen and her boyfriend Chad are spending an evening together when Karen's daughter becomes frightened by a bloodied man walking in their yard.  Chad goes out to investigate and doesn't return, prompting Karen to investigate.  She comes across his severely mutilated corpse in the yard, which is examined the next morning by Davidson.  A preliminary autopsy performed by Davidson, who is also the town's physician, determines that Chad was killed and eaten by more than one human.  He also discovers that Chad's hypothalamus is growing at an exponential rate despite his being dead.  Davidson then discovers a bacterium in the corpse he has never seen before, prompting him to speculate that the bacterium is the result of interplanetary contamination.
Brooke rides her bike home from town and discovers a horde of bloodied strangers attacking her family.  The attackers act like zombies, chasing down and feeding on anyone they encounter.  The infected kill Brooke's mom and brother before she manages to escape.  Her father also makes it out, deciding to jog into town.  Max encounters the infected at a campsite and is forced to abandon his patrol car and walk back to the sheriff's office.  He meets up with a battered Davidson, who is attacked and bitten.  During the melee, Davidson bites Max on his leg and apparently infects him as well.  Brooke stumbles across the military man in the hazard suit shown in the beginning and together they make it back to the armored vehicles.  Brooke uses a satellite phone to alert the military to the danger before being forced to flee alone.
An infected Max drives another police cruiser out of town and crashes it on the side of the road.  He climbs into the back, trapping himself in the car.  Brooke finds the cruiser and gets inside, where Max confesses his love for her and shows her an engagement ring he bought for her.  The infected surround the cruiser and attempt to get in.  When they break the windows to the back, Brooke and Max decide to try and fight their way out.  The movie ends as the two rush out of the cruiser shooting, leaving the viewer to speculate as to their fate.

''Fangoria'' announced it as part of their ''Fangoria Presents'' series of VOD and DVD releases in April 2013.
Additional production information is available in a handful of "making of" videos released by Fangoria as part of its release of the film.  The first one is "Getting the Bug Part One"; it and the others are located on Fangoria's website, Fangoria.com.http://www.fangoria.com/new/fangoria-presents-germ-z-getting-the-bug-part-one/
Reel Advice wrote "there's no denying that what will be presented here is easily one of the most bombastic, exciting, and often scary zombie films that has been put up in some time. That's extraordinary for a zombie movie, and frankly, it's a little out of the ordinary for most any movie of any type in some time. If you're looking for a zombie movie that's every bit a match for Romero at his best, then "Germ Z" is going to be a great place to look.http://www.acidlogic.com/ra_germ_z.htm"
The Other View wrote: "Though I have a few qualms with GermZ, overall I was pretty impressed with the film. The story is dark, gorey, well paced, with lots of action. Though the action kicks in at the jump, it takes a little time for the full story to settle in and once it does, it does an excellent job of holding your attention with a nice balance of story with savage eatery. From a guy who's not a fan of these types of films, I'd have to say GermZ was a pretty decent experience".http://www.the-other-view.com/germz.html
Horror Society rated it 5.2/10 and wrote, "The gore factor is pretty high, and we all love lots and lots of violence. The suspense level is high as well, as is the performances from all the actors. The production value is a little low for a larger budgeted indie film. And believe it or not, Germ Z does have some funny points and one or two spine chilling moments."  It also notes that "There is absolutely nothing new brought to the zombie cinema world here."
Lea Lawrynowicz of HorrorNews.Net called it "a really obvious, run of the mill, typical zombie flick".  She also noted that "Germ Z", ain't all bad. Production values are good, even if it's clear the budget is a bit too slim to pull off reasonable looking military headquarters at the beginning, and the meteor crash leaves a bit to be desired. There are a few definite weak spots in the cast, but the acting is surprisingly good. The deputy especially is played by a compelling actor who raises the films credibility level...While it kinda pissed me off, it also managed to hold my interest, with the action sequences providing good, solid entertainment."
Director J.T. Boone has expressed interest in making a sequel, saying that he wants to "satisfy his own curiosity about what happens next."

'''''The Dead 2: India''''' is a zombie horror film released in 2013. It is a sequel to, and follows up on the events of ''The Dead'' (2010). ''The Dead 2: India'' was produced by Road Trip Pictures in association with Latitude Films, directed by the Ford brothers, and stars Joseph Millson, Meenu Mishra, and Anand Krishna Goyal. In this movie, the action is set in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra.
A ship from Somalia docks at Mumbai, India. As the workers disembark, one is seen to be infected. He picks up his pay and then disappears into the crowd unnoticed. His coming to India triggers a zombie infestation. Meanwhile, American Nicholas Burton (Joseph Millson), a turbine engineer, works at a wind farm in Rajasthan, 30 kilometers from Jaipur. Nicholas is in a long-distance relationship with an Indian woman, Ishani Sharma (Meenu), from Mumbai. Ishani's parents are aware of her relationship with Nicholas and do not approve of it.
Ishani goes to a hospital for a check up and sees lots of people with bite wounds. Meanwhile, as he is working atop a wind turbine, Nicholas sees a family evacuate their home in hurry. Ishani phones Nicholas and informs him that she is pregnant, and she is worried about her safety with the incidents happening on the streets.
Nicholas phones his friend Max, who is aware of the fighting in the streets, but believes it to be fighting among two communities. Nicholas soon has his first encounter with the zombies and phones Ishani, promising to come for her. He phones Max again, who informs him that American citizens are being evacuated from India and asks him to show up at either New Delhi or Mumbai to escape from India. Nicholas instead keeps his promise to Ishani, going back to get her. He soon realizes that the dead are coming back to life. By the time Nicholas finishes his phone call, he is surrounded by zombies and gets trapped in a paragliding institute. Unable to get back to his jeep, he paraglides off the building to safety.
Nicholas crash lands in a village and rescues an orphan named Javed (Anand Goyal) from zombies. Javed turns out to be a guide, and he offers to help Nicholas reach Mumbai. They take a car from the house of a dead local tour operator; Javed injures his hand in the process. They reach a military checkpoint and see military personnel killing people with wounds, so Nicholas and Javed take another route through the mountains, having to ditch their car after an accident on the road. They soon find a motorbike and hit the road again.
Meanwhile, the conditions in Mumbai are deteriorating rapidly. Ishani's mother is bitten and she is dying. Ishani's father, a preacher, starts believing that the end is near. The father and daughter bond again with death so near. Javed and Nicholas stop for food and their motorbike is stolen by a desperate man. Now on foot, they walk through the desert. Javed is rescued by the Indian Army and is separated from Nicholas. Nicholas finds the stolen bike and rides all the way to Mumbai.
Ishani's father gets bitten, and Nicholas finally reaches her house. Ishani's father now realizes that Nicholas truly loves his daughter. He allows them to go and stays behind to succumb to his wounds. Nicholas and Ishani reach a camp set up by the military where they find Javed. The camp is bombed by the military, and the camp building collapses. The movie ends with Nicholas, Javed and Ishani trapped with their fates unknown.

'''''Dead Rising: Watchtower''''' is a 2015 American action zombie film directed by Zach Lipovsky, produced by Tomas Harlan and Tim Carter, and written by Tim Carter. The film stars Jesse Metcalfe, Dennis Haysbert, Virginia Madsen, Meghan Ory, Keegan Connor Tracy, and Rob Riggle. It is based on the video game of the same name, principal photography began on September 30, 2014, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Legendary Pictures produced the picture as its first digital film through its Legendary Digital Media division and it was released on Crackle on March 27, 2015.
Set between the events of ''Dead Rising 2'' and ''Dead Rising 3'', the story follows online reporter Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan as they cover the stories of the people inside of the walled-in quarantined area in the fictional town of East Mission, Oregon, as the government (running an organization called F.E.Z.A.-Federal Emergency Zombie Authority) attempts to contain a viral outbreak that turns people into ravenous zombies. An anti-viral drug called Zombrex, that keeps the virus at bay, is being administered to those infected. When it becomes clear that the drug is no longer effective and a zombie outbreak purges the town and infects its inhabitants, Chase, Jordan, grieving mother Maggie, and survivor Crystal battle their way out of the city before it gets firebombed. Throughout the film, it is revealed that the Army implanted bad Zombrex in a refugee center to start another outbreak so that the government can be allowed to plant government-mandated Zombrex chips on the infected to track them, framing F.E.Z.A. for giving bad Zombrex to the infected. The coin that Jordan gave to Chase to open a newspaper vending machine at the beginning came in handy when she placed evidence of the Army sabotaging the Zombrex inside the vending machine for him to find. When General Lyons figures out that Jordan and Norton are aware of the Army's actions, he has his men capture them to cover up the truth. In the end, Chase and Crystal managed to survive and get out of city and Jordan manages to get footage proving the Army's compliance in the new outbreak to Chase, who finds it in the newspaper vending machine, but the same footage shows her being taken and probably killed by the military and the U.S. government are allowed to implant tracking chips on people who are infected.

'''''Michael Jackson's Thriller''''' is a 13-minute horror-themed music video for the song of the same name, released on December 2, 1983. Directed by John Landis, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Jackson, the song was released from Jackson's sixth studio album of the same name. It was MTV's first world premiere video. In the UK the video was aired on Channel 4 late at night. Voted as the most influential pop music video of all time, and was named "a watershed moment for the [music] industry" for its unprecedented merging of filmmaking and music.
''Guinness World Records'' listed it in 2006 as the "most successful music video", selling over nine million copies.
Co-starring with Jackson was former ''Playboy'' centerfold Ola Ray. The video was choreographed by Michael Peters (who had worked with the singer on his prior hit "Beat It"), and Jackson. Jackson contacted Landis after seeing his film ''An American Werewolf in London''; make-up artist Rick Baker and composer Elmer Bernstein (who composed incidental music for the video) were also brought from the film to work on the video. The video (like the song) contains a spoken word performance by horror film veteran Vincent Price. "Thriller" was the third and final video for the ''Thriller'' album. The red jacket that Jackson wore was designed by Landis' wife Deborah Landis to make him appear more "virile".
To qualify for an Academy Award as a short subject, the film was shown in a theatrical screening along with the 1940 Disney animated feature ''Fantasia'', in December 1983; however, the video failed to earn an Academy Award nomination.
Due to Jackson being a Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness at the time, the video begins with a disclaimer that reads:
On a night set in the 1950s, a teenaged Michael and his unnamed girlfriend (Ola Ray), run out of gas while driving in a wooded area. They walk into the forest as they leave the car behind and Michael asks her to be his girlfriend. She accepts and he gives her a ring. However, he then tells her that he is "not like other guys." She tells him that's the reason she likes him, but Michael insists that she doesn't understand what he means. As his girlfriend asks what he's talking about, a full moon appears, and Michael begins transforming into a werecat, growling at her to leave in the process. The girl screams in terror and attempts to escape, but the werecat chases her, knocks her down, lunges at her with his claws, and attacks her (off-screen). The scene then cuts to a movie theater where Michael and his unnamed girlfriend, along with an excitable audience, are actually watching the scene unfold in a Vincent Price horror movie titled "Thriller". Afraid, Michael's girlfriend leaves the theater. Michael hands his popcorn to another moviegoer, catches up with her, and tells her that, "It's only a movie" and his girlfriend informs him that it wasn't funny. Some debate follows as to whether or not she was scared by the movie; she denies it, but Michael disagrees.
They then walk down a foggy road as Michael sings verses of the song excluding the chorus. They pass a nearby graveyard, in which the undead begin to rise out of their graves as Vincent Price's speech is heard. The zombies corner the two main characters threateningly, and suddenly, Michael becomes a zombie himself. The zombies then break into an elaborate song and dance number, followed by the main chorus of "Thriller" (during which Michael reverts to human form), frightening his date to the point where she runs for cover. Michael (who has turned back into a zombie) and his fellow corpses chase the terrified girl into the room of a nearby abandoned house. While being cornered, Michael then reaches for the girl's throat as she lets out a horrifying shriek, only to awake and realize it was all a nightmare. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily accepts. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns to the camera with a sinister grin, revealing his yellow werecat eyes from the opening scene, as Vincent Price offers one last spine-tingling and echoing laugh. As the credits are shown, a reprise scene is shown and at the end of the credits the zombies dance back to their graves as a disclaimer appears saying that "Any similarity to actual events or persons living, dead, (or undead) is purely coincidental", the same disclaimer that appeared in  ''An American Werewolf in London'' also directed by Landis. After that, a zombie breaks the fourth wall and gives a terrifying grimace to the audience as the screen fades to black.

In the summer of 1983, ''Thriller'' had begun to decline in sales. Walter Yetnikoff and Larry Stessel answered calls throughout the night from Jackson. "Walter, the record isn't No. 1 anymore," Yetnikoff recalls Jackson saying. "What are we going to do about it?" 'We're going to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow,'" Yetnikoff remembered answering. Jackson manager Frank DiLeo first mentioned the idea of making a third video, and pressed Jackson to consider the album's title track. "It's simple-all you've got to do is dance, sing, and make it scary," DiLeo recalls telling Jackson.
In early August, after seeing ''An American Werewolf in London'', Jackson contacted John Landis to direct the video. At the time, commercial motion-picture directors did not direct music videos, but Landis was intrigued.
The music video was filmed at the Palace Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, the zombie dance sequence at the junction of Union Pacific Avenue and South Calzona Street in East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles and the final house scene in the Angeleno Heights neighborhood at 1345 Carroll Avenue. All principal photography was done in mid-October 1983.
In an interview that aired December 11, 1999 for MTV's ''100 Greatest Videos Ever Made'', Jackson spoke about the making of the video:

'''''The Dead Don't Die''''' is a 1975 American television film|made-for-television neo-noir horror thriller film set in the 1930s, directed by Curtis Harrington from a teleplay by Robert Bloch, author of the novel ''Psycho''. Bloch based his teleplay upon his own story of the same title that first appeared in ''Fantastic Adventures'', July 1951. The film originally premiered on NBC on January 14, 1975.
Bloch gives his opinion of the movie in his autobiography, ''Once Around the Bloch''. "''The Dead Don't Die''. Maybe they don't, but the show did. Despite Curtis's casting of accomplished character actors, their supporting roles couldn't prop up the lead. And Ray Milland, who had given such a deftly paced performance in my script for ''Home Away from Home'', merely plodded through his part here like a zombie without a deadline." Robert Bloch, ''Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorised Autobiography'' NY: Tor Books, 1993, 363-64.
In 1934, Don Drake returns to Chicago after a long sea voyage and discovers that his brother has been convicted of murdering his wife.

'''''Wyrmwood''''' (also known as '''''Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead''''') is a 2014 Australian action-horror film that follows a mechanic who finds himself faced with zombie hordes. This feature film directorial debut of Kiah Roache-Turner
Mechanic Barry lives in the Australian outback with his wife Annie and daughter Meganne. During a meteor shower, Barry's sister Brooke is attacked in her Bulla, Victoria studio by her model and her assistant, who have suddenly become zombies. She calls Barry and warns him to get out of the city. He, Annie, and Meganne don gas masks and fight their way to the family car. When Meganne and Annie remove their gas masks they become infected and zombify, and Barry is forced to kill them with a nailgun. He runs out of nails before he can kill himself.
Chalker, another survivor, finds Barry and knocks him unconscious when Barry attempts to kill himself with Chalker's gun. Barry asks Chalker to take him to Brooke's studio, unaware that a paramilitary group has taken her captive in the back of a truck that serves as a mobile lab for mad scientist Doc. While Doc experiments on the zombies and Brooke, Chalker's truck stops working. Chalker and Barry continue on foot, and Benny, another survivor, mistakenly kills Chalker. Benny, who previously had to kill his infected brother, and Barry team up and come upon a garage staffed by Frank and his assistant. Frank explains that all flammable liquids have become useless. However, the group accidentally discovers zombie breath and blood are flammable, and they devise a zombie-powered engine. During their escape, Frank's assistant becomes infected and is used as fuel.
Barry, Benny, and Frank discover zombies stop breathing flammable gas at night, enabling them to run faster. As they hole up in the truck overnight, Frank says he believes the zombies resulted from the meteor shower; as told in the Bible, a star called Wyrmwood has fallen, making part of the world bitter. After waking up from a nightmare, Barry catches a zombie on fire and accidentally sets the truck's compressor alight. While putting out the fire, Frank is bitten and asks Barry to shoot him; Barry does. The next day, Barry and Benny encounter paramilitaries in a electric-powered truck. The two drivers, after revealing that those with an A negative blood type are not affected by the disease, offer to lead Barry and Benny to Brooke, who they claim is in custody nearby. Meanwhile, Brooke learns she can now telepathically control zombies as a result of the experiments. With the help of several zombies, she kills Doc, escapes the truck, and joins Barry and Benny.
Barry's truck stalls after the soldiers accidentally kill the zombie powering it. While taking a pit stop for Brooke to fetch them a zombie, Benny is shot in the stomach. When they later pull over to take care of Benny, the soldiers catch up and subdue them. The soldiers reveal their plan is to decapitate Brooke and take her head to their commanding officer. Barry plans to kill them all in an explosion, but Benny instead sacrifices himself to turn into a zombie so Brooke can control him to overpower the soldiers. He kills two of the three soldiers, but the captain kills him and shoots Brooke in the chest. Barry challenges him to a fistfight but ends up shot when the captain retrieves his pistol. After shooting a zombie, the captain's face is splattered with zombie blood, and Barry ignites his head with the matches. Before Barry can shoot him, Brooke rises and commands a horde of zombies to eat the captain alive.
Barry and Brooke, back on the road, come across the lab truck again. They ask the soldiers what they have in the back of the truck; when they refuse to answer, Brooke commands a new group of zombies to attack them and tear them apart.

Critical reception for ''Wyrmwood'' has been positive, IGN awarded it 7.5 out of 10, saying "Wyrmwood may tread familiar ground, but it's still a bloody good time."http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/02/02/wyrmwood-road-of-the-dead-review
''Wyrmwood'' was reviewed in ''The West Australian'' : "with clear inspirations in ''Dawn of the Dead'', ''The Evil Dead'', ''Bad Taste'', ''Re-Animator'' and ... ''Mad Max'', from its Gothic-looking helmets, masks and weapons to its retro-fitted vehicles, ''Wyrmwood'' looks and plays a lot better than its $160,000 budget suggests."  
The film premiered as ''Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead''
In February 2015, a plan for a sequel was announced, with a potential return of the original actors Jay Gallagher, Bianca Bradey, Leon Burchill, Luke McKenzie, and Yure Covich.

'''''Sick: Survive the Night''''' is a 2012 Canadian horror film directed by Ryan M. Andrews, written by Andrews and Chris Cull, and starring Christina Annie Aceto, Richard Sutton, Robert Nolan, and Debbie Rochon.  Survivors of a Zombie#Zombie_apocalypse|zombie apocalypse attempt to find a cure and stay alive overnight during a siege.
Survivors in a military bunker recruit Dr. Leigh Rozetta, a scientist, to find a cure for the zombie plague that has ravaged humanity.  When she retreats to her parents' house, several survivalists join her along the way.  The group attempts to survive the zombie hordes while dealing with their interpersonal issues.

* Richard Sutton as Seph Copeland
* Robert Nolan as Mckay Jacobs
* Jennifer Polansky as Claudia Silveira
* Debbie Rochon as Dr. Joselda Fehmi 
The film was originally intended to be a short.  When the plot developed beyond these limits, it was converted into a feature-length production.  Andrews wanted to create a unique mythology for his film, so he worked to differentiate his zombies from the ones that he had seen in other films.  One of his ideas was to take a meme associated with zombie films, that zombies eat brains, treat it seriously, and add a scientific rationale.
''Sick: Survive the Night'' premiered at the Blood on the Snow Canadian Film Festival.  Midnight Releasing released it on home video on January 6, 2015.
Lacey Paige of ''Diabolique Magazine'' called it "a decent little independent zombie film" that "offers a unique take" on a tired subgenre.  Dominic Cuthbert of ''Starburst'' rated it 5/10 stars and wrote, "Given its low budget, Andrews taps into the indie spirit with gusto, putting drama over horror, and while the blood doesn't splatter every which way, the performances fail to ignite."

'''''Ninja Apocalypse''''' is a 2014 American martial arts film directed by Lloyd Lee Barnett, written by Ashley Scott Meyers, and starring Christian Oliver, Les Brandt, Tara Macken, Kaiwi Lyman, and Isaac C. Singleton Jr. as ninjas who are framed for the assassination of a respected clan leader (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa).  It was released direct-to-video on August 5, 2014.
In a post-apocalyptic future where the survivors have banded together into ninja clans, representatives of the Lost Ninja Clan - brothers Cage and Surge, deaf-mute Sky, Trillion, and Mar - are called to an underground bunker to attend a peace conference.  Each of the ninja clans has a magic power, and the Lost Ninja Clan control electricity.  Fumitaka, a respected clan leader, believes that the disparate ninja clans are under threat by an external force.  He proposes that they band together to increase their chances of survival.  Though this is well received by the assembled clans, he is assassinated at the end of his speech.  Three witnesses step forward to identify Cage, the leader of the Lost Ninja Clan, as the assassin.  Confused and protesting his innocence, Cage leads his clan to safety as they fight through the hostile crowd.  Trillian uses most of his magical power reserves to temporarily knock most of the other ninja unconscious.
The Lost Ninja Clan separate to explore the bunker; each fight off several opponents, though Mar is eventually overwhelmed and killed.  After they bury Mar, Trillion leads them to an elevator he scouted.  They fight through ninja commanded by Becker, head of a rival ninja clan that uses fire-based powers, and each clan accuses the other of being Fumitaka's assassin.  However, the elevator is a decoy, and it takes them to the bottom level, where the Lost Ninja Clan encounter hordes of zombies.  Trillion is bitten, and the clan panics.  Surge and Cage fight for leadership of the clan until Sky steps in to stop them.  A repeating message from Hiroshi, Fumitaka's lieutenant, reveals the existence of a second, working elevator, though it cuts out before he can give the location.  The clan fights through the zombies to the working elevator, and Sky sacrifices himself to give the others a chance to escape.
Demoralized, the survivors continue on, only to be stopped by the Siren Clan, an all-female clan composed of seeming clones.  Initially friendly, the Siren Clan seduces the Lost Ninja Clan, then viciously attacks.  Trillion is killed, and Surge is poisoned.  Cage and Surge fight their way to the exit, where Becker again confronts them.  Cage and Becker fight each other; when Cage spares Becker's life, Becker questions Cage's guilt.  As Cage and Surge stop to get medicine, a double of Cage appears and stabs Surge.  Hiroshi reveals himself as a shapeshifter and says that he killed Fumitaka to prevent Cage from becoming Fumitaka's new lieutenant.  Weakened and with his powers exhausted, Cage is outmatched by Hiroshi.  Before Hiroshi can finish off Cage, Surge recovers and kills Hiroshi.  Afterward, Becker, impressed with Cage's honor and skill, swears loyalty to him.

Shawn Austin, founder of Big Boss Creative, produced the film after becoming interested in expanding his involvement in the entertainment business.  Instead of producing a film and finding a distributor, he went directly to the distribution companies and asked them what they wanted.  They told him that ninja films were currently in demand.
A screening took place at the 2014 San Diego Comic Con.  ''Ninja Apocalypse'' was released direct-to-video on August 5, 2014, in the United States.
Reviews were mixed; positive reviews highlighted the fight choreography, while negatives ones criticized the plot as derivative.  Paul Mount of ''Starburst'' rated it 2/10 and wrote, "Horribly bland and charmless, ''Ninja Apocalypse'' will surely only appeal to undemanding action fans who still can't resist the allure of any tacky film with the word 'ninja' in the title."

'''''The Earth Dies Screaming''''' is a 1964 British science fiction film directed by Terence Fisher, and starring Willard Parker, Virginia Field, Dennis Price, Vanda Godsell,  Thorley Walters, David Spenser, and Anna Palk.John Hamilton, ''The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70'' Hemlock Books 2013 p 129-132
After a mysterious gas attack which kills off most of the Earth's population, a few survivors gather at a country inn to figure out a plan for survival. However, the gas attack is only the first step in an alien invasion, in which groups of bullet proof killer robots stalk the streets, able to kill anyone with the a mere touch of their hands. The group's members find additional weaponry in a nearby drill hall, but the robots continue their campaign of terror, which only increases when their victims rise from the dead as zombies, eager to kill anyone who might try to stop them. Yet despite frictions within the group -- and the birth of a baby, which further complicates matters -- most of the members survive. After discovering that the robots in the area are being controlled from a local transmitting tower, the survivors blow it up and head to a nearby airport, where they commandeer a plane and fly south, towards an unknown destination, hoping additional survivors see their plane and join them.
The film was shot in black and white at Shepperton Studios in London. Location filming was done at the village of Shere in Surrey. It was one of several 1960s British horror films to be scored by the avant-garde Elisabeth Lutyens, whose father, Edwin Lutyens, designed Manor House Lodge in Shere, a small property which features prominently at several points in the film.
Wheeler Winston Dixon wrote about the film's use of silence:
Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle cited the film as "an obvious precursor to ''Night of the Living Dead''.
''The Earth Dies Screaming'' was used in 1983 as the inspiration (and title) for an obscure Atari 2600 video game.  The game is set in space, and has you shooting down satellites and fighter ships.http://www.mobygames.com/game/earth-dies-screaming/
The British band UB40 used ''The Earth Dies Screaming'' as the title for a 1980 single release (catalogue: Graduate GRAD 10), which spent 12 weeks in the UK chart, peaking at number 10.

'''''Prince of Darkness''''' is a 1987 American supernatural horror film directed, written and scored by John Carpenter. The film is the second installment in Carpenter's ''Apocalypse Trilogy'', which began with ''The Thing'' (1982) and concludes with ''In the Mouth of Madness'' (1994).
A priest invites Professor Howard Birack and his students to join him in the basement of an abandoned Los Angeles church. He requires their assistance in investigating a mysterious cylinder containing a swirling green liquid. Among those present is Brian Marsh, a student in theoretical physics.
They decipher the text found next to the cylinder which describes the liquid as the corporeal embodiment of Satan. The liquid appears sentient, and broadcasts increasingly complex streams of data. The academics use a computer to analyze the data, and find that it includes differential equations. Over a period of two days, small jets of liquid escape from the cylinder. Members of the group exposed to the liquid become possessed by the entity, which uses them against the others. Attempts to escape from the building are thwarted by a mass of possessed street people who surround it and barricade the doors from the outside. Two members of the research group are killed.
Birack and the priest theorize that Satan is actually the offspring of an even more powerful force of evil, the "Anti-God", who is bound to the realm of anti-matter. The survivors find themselves sharing a recurring dream (apparently a tachyon transmission sent as a warning from the future year "one-nine-nine-nine") showing a shadowy figure emerging from the front of the church. The hazy transmission changes slightly with each occurrence of the dream, revealing progressively more detail. The narration of the transmission each time instructs the dreamer that they are witnessing an actual broadcast from the future, and they must prevent this possible outcome.
Eventually, the cylinder opens and the remaining liquid is absorbed into the body of student Kelly, who transforms into the physical vessel of Satan: a gruesomely disfigured being, with powers of telekinesis and regeneration.  Satan attempts to summon the Anti-God through a dimensional portal using a mirror, but the mirror is too small and the effort fails.
While the rest of the team is occupied fighting the possessed, Kelly finds a larger wall mirror and draws the Anti-God's hand through it. Brian's lover and fellow physicist, Catherine Danforth, is the only one free to act: she tackles Kelly, causing both of them to fall through the portal. The priest shatters the mirror, trapping Kelly, the Anti-God, and Catherine in the other realm. Catherine is seen briefly on the other side of the mirror reaching out to the portal before it closes. Immediately, the possessed die, the street people wander away, and the survivors (Brian, Birack, The Priest, and Walter) are rescued.
Brian has the recurring dream again, except that now Catherine, apparently possessed, is the figure emerging from the church. Brian awakens and finds Catherine, gruesomely disfigured, lying in bed with him. This is still part of his dream, however, and he awakens screaming. Rising, he approaches his bedroom mirror, hand outstretched.

''Prince of Darkness'' was shot in Los Angeles, California in 30 days. Carpenter became inspired while researching theoretical physics and atomic theory. He recalled, "I thought it would be interesting to create some sort of ultimate evil and combine it with the notion of matter and anti-matter." This idea, which would eventually develop into the screenplay for ''Prince of Darkness'', was to be the first of a multi-picture deal with Alive Pictures, where Carpenter was allocated $3 million per picture and complete creative control.Boulenger, pp. 201
Executive producer Shep Gordon was also manager to singer Alice Cooper, and suggested Cooper record a song for the film. Carpenter also cast Cooper as one of the homeless zombies. Cooper allowed the "impaling device" from his stage show to be used in the film in the scene where Cooper's character kills Etchinson.Boulenger, pp. 204 The song Cooper wrote for the film, also titled "Prince of Darkness", can be heard briefly in the same scene playing through Etchinson's headphones.
Carpenter cast people that he had worked with previously, including Victor Wong, Dennis Dun and Donald Pleasence. It was Peter Jason's first film for Carpenter, and would afterward become a Carpenter regular.
The film was shot with wide-angle lenses, which combined with anamorphic format to create a lot of distortion.
Carpenter wrote the screenplay but was credited as "Martin Quatermass", which along with the name of Professor Birack's institution ("Kneale University") was an homage to British film and television writer Nigel Kneale and his best-known character, Bernard Quatermass. The story features elements associated with Kneale, including a confrontation with ancient evil (''Quatermass and the Pit'' and ''The Quatermass Conclusion''), messages from the future (''The Road''), and the scientific investigation of the paranormal (''The Stone Tape''). Kneale was displeased with the homage, fearing that viewers might believe that he had something to do with the film. He had written the original screenplay for the 1982 film ''Halloween III: Season of the Witch'' for Carpenter, but he insisted that his name be removed from the credits after director Tommy Lee Wallace made extensive changes to the script without his approval.
The name "Danforth" is also the name of one of the main characters in H.P. Lovecraft's ''At the Mountains of Madness'', who accompanies the narrator in his trip past the eponymous mountains, and apparently sees something that even the narrator misses as they leave.
Carpenter returned to the idea of ancient clerical secrets in ''Vampires''.
The poster for ''Prince of Darkness'' was created and designed by Henry Rosenthal, who worked for print production vendor Rod Dyer.
According to Carpenter in the DVD audio commentary, the post-production was done at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California|Burbank, California.
In an interview with Michael Doyle in the November 2012 issue of ''Rue Morgue'', John Carpenter revealed how he created the eerie dream sequences in ''Prince of Darkness'' that feature a shadowy figure emerging from a church doorway. Carpenter first shot the action of the figure (played by actor Jessie Ferguson) with a video camera and then "re-photographed it on a television set" in order to give the image a peculiar, dislocated feeling that also appeared as if it was being filmed live. Doyle also reminded Carpenter that the director himself provided the disembodied voice that narrates each dream.
''Prince of Darkness'' was poorly received critically upon release. In his review for the ''Washington Post'', Richard Harrington wrote, "At one point Pleasence vows that 'it's a secret that can no longer be kept.' Here's another:  In Leonard Maltin's annual publication "TV Movie Guide," the film is given a BOMB rating. Nigel Floyd in ''Time Out'' was more positive about the film, calling ''Prince of Darkness'' "engrossing" and adding "the claustrophobic terror generated by fluid camerawork and striking angles" leads "to a heart-racing climax".Nigel Floyd, "Prince of Darkness" in John Pym, "Time Out Film Guide 2011".

In 2004, Jim Emerson wrote that ''Prince of Darkness'' was an undervalued horror film: "What makes me goose-pimply about ''Prince of Darkness'' is its goofy-but-ingenious central conceit and its truly Surrealistic imagery, some of which could have sprouted out of Luis Buñuel|Buñuel and Salvador Dalí|Dali's ''Un Chien Andalou''."Emerson, Jim (October 14, 2004). .

In 1988, the film was nominated for a Saturn Award for best music, and won the Critics Award at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival.

'''''Invisible Invaders''''' is a 1959 science fiction film starring John Agar, Jean Byron, John Carradine and Philip Tonge. It was produced by Robert E. Kent, directed by Edward L. Cahn and written by Samuel Newman.
Dr. Karol Noymann (Carradine), an atomic scientist, is killed in a laboratory explosion. His colleague, Dr. Adam Penner (Tonge), is disturbed by the accident and resigns his position and calls for changes.
At Dr. Noymann's funeral, an invisible alien takes over Noymann's dead body. The alien, in Noymann's body, visits Dr. Penner and tells him the earth must surrender or an alien force will invade and take over the earth by inhabiting the dead and causing chaos. The alien demonstrates to Penner that they are able to make things invisible. Penner tells his daughter Phyllis (Byron) and Dr. John Lamont (Robert Hutton) about the experience and asks Dr. Lamont to relay the message to the government in Washington, D.C.. The government ignores the warning and Dr. Penner is labeled a crank by the media.
Dr. Penner takes his daughter and Dr. Lamont to Dr. Noymann's grave, where they are visited by an invisible alien. Later, at the site of a plane crash, another alien takes over the body of a dead pilot (Don Kennedy), goes to a hockey game, chokes the announcer, and issues an ultimatum for the earth to surrender. Another alien take over a dead body from a car crash and issues the same ultimatum at a different sporting event. The media announce the threat and the governments of the world decide to resist the invasion. Aliens take over more dead bodies and blow up dams, cause fires and destroy buildings.
Maj. Bruce Jay (Agar) arrives to take Dr. Penner, Phyllis and Dr. Lamont to a secret bunker. On the way, they are confronted by a scared farmer (Hal Torey) who tries to take their vehicle. Maj. Jay kills the farmer and they proceed to the bunker while an alien takes over the dead farmer's body.
At the bunker, they are contacted by the government and tasked with stopping the alien invasion. They determine that the aliens are radioactive, and decide to capture an alien to conduct tests on. They attempt to spray an alien with acrylic to seal it in plastic, but this fails. They then fill a hole with the acrylic liquid and lure an alien into it. Once captured, the alien is taken to the bunker.
Back at the bunker, they confine the alien in a pressure chamber and break the acrylic using high pressure to set it free. They try several experiments, but nothing affects the alien. Frustrated and hopeless, Dr. Lamont wants to surrender, but Maj. Jay does not. The two men fight and inadvertently damage some electronic equipment, setting off a loud alarm. They notice that the alien reacts violently to the noise.
They make a sound gun and test it on the alien, causing it to become visible and killing it in the process. They try to inform the government, but their radio broadcast is jammed by the aliens, who are apparently nearby. Using a radio direction finder they follow the jamming signal to the alien ship, killing several aliens along the way. Maj. Jay walks through the woods to get to the ship and is confronted by several aliens. He kills them with the sound gun but is shot in the process. Despite being wounded, he finds the alien ship and shoots it with the sound gun, causing the ship to explode. With the jamming signal silenced, Dr. Penner is then able to contact the government and tell them how to stop the aliens while Phyllis tends to Maj. Jay's wound.
Later, at the United Nations, Dr. Penner, Dr. Lamont, Phyllis Penner and Maj. Jay receive thanks for saving the world from the alien invasion.

'''''I Was a Zombie for the F.B.I.''''' is a 1982 science fiction black-and-white film. It was directed by Marius Penczner and filmed by students from Memphis State University, now known as the University of Memphis.
After landing by Pleasantville, United States, the aliens convince two Earth criminals to help them rule the world. The aliens hypnotize people into a "zomboid state" and unleash a reptilian creature. Two F.B.I. agents fight against the aliens, criminals, and the creature to combat the threat of imminent world domination.
Inspired by 1950s science fiction films, '' I Was a Zombie for the F.B.I.'' was filmed in black-and-white by Memphis State students and was directed by Marius Penczner. The film's budget was $27,000, which came from the director's Emmy award-winning short film.
The stop motion reptilian monster was later used in the director's film ''TV Dinners''.
Bob Dylan and Dennis Hopper enjoyed the film, same with the bands ZZ Top and The Everly Brothers. Dylan said that he wished he was in the film.
Mac McEntire, writing for ''DVD Verdict'', said that he liked the film, but that "long stretches of dialogue with little to no action might be true to the era to which this film pays tribute, but it might move a little too slowly for some of today's viewers". Andy McKeague, of ''Monsters and Critics'', wrote that "''Zombie'' is a fun film, but one you need to be in the right mood for. It has all the markings of the 50's TV cop shows it deliberately resembles and enough of the E.T. savvy to appeal to fans of ''Plan 9'' to ''The X-files''".
The film was first released on USA Network in 1995. It was released on DVD in 2005 with title cards, new footage, new effects, and different music. The director removed 33 minutes of footage from the film.

'''''Battle of the Bone''''' is an 2008 Irish independent zombie film written and directed by George Clarke, and is claimed as Northern Ireland's "first ever" kung-fu zombie movie.
A group of friends consisting of Todd, Aaron, Lane, Broderick, Jane, and Kerry are rushing to take part in protests that are occurring in Belfast. They at first have fun dodging police and advancing the cause, but become suspicious when they see the military arrive. They soon realize that the protesters are turning into zombies. The zombies break down the door of the Port-a-Potty Broderick is in and kill him. Aaron is also decapitated when he tries to run to the car while a masked person tries to rape Jane but zombies eat both of them.
Todd, Kerry and Lane manage to reach the military blockade, but the soldiers refuse to let them through and shoot Lane. Todd and Kerry lock themselves in a car and when they realize they won't be making it out alive, they make out and start having sex. However, the zombies around the car become distracted by the presence of a military tank. The coast is not clear, however, because a zombified Lane appears and bites Kerry's throat before Todd kills both of them. After the soldiers are eaten alive, Todd hijacks the tank and uses it to escape.
Todd leaves Belfast in the tank but is accosted by another group of soldiers outside the city. They climb in the tank but one remaining zombie hiding inside a closet kills them all while Todd climbs in their Jeep and drives off. He comes across the last group of soldiers, who are trying to escape in a helicopter, but all of them are killed by zombies except one soldier and the pilot. Todd makes it into the helicopter just in time but the pilot accidentally shoots himself in the head while trying to throw Todd out. Todd manages to fly the helicopter using his experience with video games but the soldier transforms into a zombie, so Todd breaks his neck and throws him out of the helicopter. Todd then flies the helicopter to safety and hears a news broadcast claiming that there were no survivors, eliciting a chuckle from him.

Both the film's title and its plot timeline being set on 12 July, stem from King William III's 12 July 1690 Battle of the Boyne.  Created on a budget of £10,000, the filmmaker chose The Troubles as the film's inspiration and as a means to address the issue of division with a twist that shows the two sides of the Belfast community joining together to deal with a common threat.
The film first screened in Belfast, on 17 July 2008, and was followed by a DVD release on 23 October 2008.  The film also secured an exclusive partnership with DVD rental kiosk operator The Movie Booth to offer rental copies of the movie in Belfast based DVD rental machines.
Writer/director George Clarke joined the film's stars Alan Crawford and Shane Todd in a promotion tour to sign DVDs and pose for photographs.
The movie showed in October 2008 at The Freakshow Horror Film Festival in Florida. The contest was adjudicated by George A. Romero, where the film won the Audience Choice Award 2008. BOTB has also attracted interest from Hong Kong and Canada.
Canadian critical review site - www.critical-film.com described it as a "relentlessly kinetic and joyous picture; always running and usually running away, each character perpetually fighting for his/her life"
The director stated in January 2010, "''Battle of the Bone'' may have wowed genre geeks, but some mainstream critics didn't appreciate the film's queasy concoction of zombies and Orangemen."

'''''Ghost Brigade''''' is a 1993 supernatural horror film set during American Civil War and directed by George Hickenlooper. Starring Corbin Bernsen, Adrian Pasdar, and Martin Sheen, the film was also released under the alternate titles '''''The Killing Box''''', '''''Grey Knight''''',
Slave traders bring back an evil voodoo entity that is accidentally freed by the Confederate Army during the Civil War. The entity possesses the bodies of the dead soldiers to create an army of its own bent on conquest, using the corpses of both the North and South. When both Union and Confederate soldiers are mysteriously murdered by the entity during the Civil War, the opposing troops must overcome their differences and band together to investigate the gruesome deaths. It soon becomes apparent that these killers are anything but human. Instead, they are a maniacal regiment of supernatural forces, and it is solely up to these united American soldiers to fight the slaughterous evil of the Ghost Brigade.
The film centers around Captain John Harling, a Union army man that has been awaiting the end of his parole; it is cut short when there are unusual murders of Union troops. To discover the culprits behind this Harling seeks Colonel Nehemiah Strayn, a former Confederate regiment commander, now sitting in a Union prison at Bowling Green, who was once Harling's teacher. The two officers, along with Colonel George Thalman supervising, set out with a small detachment of troops and a runaway slave named Rebecca. When they reach the site where several Union troops were murdered, Strayn tells about what happened to his regiment, whose gruesome end happened at the same place where the Union corpses were found.
After leaving the site and wandering deeper into Tennessee, they come across a group of Confederate soldiers, who quickly surrender, much to the surprise of the Union troops. The Confederate in charge tells Thalman that their group was attacked by a band of undead troops who took many of his men away, yet he was unaware of why he and his people were taken. Thalman, deciding that they require reinforcements, takes off leaving Harling in charge. But during the night, while Strayn and Rebecca are talking just a few yards away from the camp, they are assaulted by Stayn's old regiment, now a bunch of walking zombies. His former second-in-command, Major Josiah Elkins, tells him to lead this new regiment. Strayn refuses the offer, however, and escapes with Rebecca to the camp. Strayn warns everyone at the camp and they all hide behind the carts that the Confederates had with them and wait until the zombie soldiers approach them. After holding them off, they are surprised to see Thalman reappear again, but he has been changed. After being burned by Rebecca he returns to his former self, But before he dies, he puts Harling in charge, in hopes that Harling will see the men out.
The next day, since they don't have time to leave the area, they set a trap for the Ghost Brigade. Using Strayn to lure them back to the Union camp, he surprises them by picking up a pistol and killing one of them with a silver bullet which was created from the silver that the Confederates were carrying. The Ghost Brigade goes into a fury and attacks the joint Union/Confederate troops, who are positioned behind a trench filled with water and wagons turned into barricades. Strayn personally fights with Elkins in hand-to-hand combat before Elkins stabs him. Before he can finish Strayn, Rebecca leaps on top of him. The short struggle continues until Rebecca shoots Elkins by aiming at her chest when he was behind her. While barely alive, Harling realizes that she is infected and has to be shot. Strayn tries to intervene but Rebecca is shot. The last remaining zombie soldier cries over Elkin's corpse before he is shot by Harling. With the Ghost Brigade defeated, they head back for Union territory, where Strayn is sent back to Bowling Green prison for a short period, before he escapes and rejoins the Confederate Army. He fights with distinction during the battles of Gettysburg and other major Civil War battles, but his unusual stand against slavery alienates many of his countrymen. While Strayn is fighting in the Confederate Army, Harling decides to not take his parole and stays with the Union Army for duration of the war, serving under General U.S. Grant for the remainder of the Civil War.
The film ends with Harling telling the story of Strayn going back to the creek where his regiment was murdered, where he is never seen again.

'''''One Dark Night''''' is a 1983 American horror film directed by Tom McLoughlin and starring Meg Tilly, E.G. Daily, and Adam West. The film follows three teenage women sent to a mausoleum for the night as part of a high school initiation rite. A dead telekinetic occultist returns from the dead and haunts them, forcing the three to survive the night inside the crypt.
The film was conceived and filmed under the title ''Rest in Piece'' before ''Poltergeist'', but due to post-production problems, the film was delayed and was released in theaters in 1983 by Comworld Pictures.
Six girls have been found murdered in the apartment of famed Russian occultist Karl Raymarseivich Raymar and the police cannot explain it. When Raymar's body was lifted onto a stretcher, bolts of electricity shot out from his fingers. His estranged daughter Olivia McKenna (Melissa Newman) and her husband Allan (Adam West) are unaware of this until they meet Samuel Dockstader (Donald Hotton), a feature writer for The World of the Occult; as a friend of Raymar, Dockstader explains that Raymar was a psychic vampire who gained great powers of telekinesis by kidnapping young girls, terrorizing them, and feeding off the bioenergy they produced. Allan does not believe him, but Dockstader shows Olivia a set of photographs to demonstrate how bioenergy works and gives her an audiotape that outlines his findings, which convinces Olivia to believe him.
Meanwhile, High school student Julie Wells (Meg Tilly) wants to be part of a club entitled The Sisters, which consist of three snobby high school girls named Carol (Robin Evans), Leslie (E.G. Daily), and Kitty (Leslie Speights). Unfortunately, Carol is the ex-girlfriend of Julie's new boyfriend Steve (David Mason Daniels), and is jealous. She intends to get back at Steve and Julie by making Julie spend a night alone in a mausoleum, unaware that Raymar's body was just entombed there. That evening, Julie is dropped off by only Carol and Kitty, as Leslie had refused to accompany them on the plan. Julie explores the mausoleum and sets up her sleeping bag, unaware of the cracks that appear around Raymar's vault.
Carol and Kitty, hoping to scare Julie, dress up in costumes and sneak back into the mausoleum. While they succeed in frightening Julie who locks herself in the chapel, they are unaware that Raymar is slowly reawakening by using his powers to make the walls shake, windows explode, and door slam shut. Before Carol and Kitty decide to leave, Raymar's powers open up the vaults containing coffins inside and many rotting cadavers telekinetically float and surround the girls before they mound underneath them to suffocate them.
Meanwhile, Steve has gone over to Julie's house to find her missing. He catches up with Leslie, who reluctantly tells Steve about Julie's initiation, and Steve angrily heads over to the mausoleum. At the same time, Olivia dashes over after learning about her father's powers and the possibility that she might also possess them. Back at the mausoleum, Raymar finally breaks out of his coffin and controls the rotting corpses and the doors with his psychic powers. Just when Steve breaks in and finds a hysterical Julie, they become surrounded by the cadavers that advance toward them. Steve tries to fight the corpses, but they knock him out. Raymar pulls a dazed Julie closer to him before Oliva arrives to save her. Ultimately, Olivia takes her compact and reflects the bolts from Raymar's eyes back at him, causing Raymar and the cadavers to disintegrate, saving Julie and Steve.
The three, including a now traumatized Julie, begin slowly walking out of the mausoleum. The film ends with Kitty's toothbrush sen near the mound of corpses inside the empty mausoleum, before a corpse falls in front and emits a scream.

Before becoming a director, Tom McLoughlin  was a struggling scriptwriter and also starred in several minor roles in film including playing the monster in John Frankenheimer's 1979 horror film ''Prophecy''.  He worked with director Woody Allen in his 1973 film ''Sleeper''. Not having much success with selling several comedy screenplays, McLoughlin and his friend Michael Hawes decided to make a gothic horror film similar to the works of Edgar Allan Poe. For inspiration McLoughlin drew upon his experience of exploring the catacombs in Paris, France when he was 19 years old, as McLoughlin recalled years later, "It was the first time that I ever felt psychological or supernatural fear. There was nothing there; there was nobody coming after me; but there was just something about knowing where I was and what I was surrounded by, that gave me a chill that was unforgettable".
McLoughlin and Hawes also came up with the idea of a group of people being trapped inside a mausoleum with a "psychic vampire" that fed on the life energy of the other members of the group. After a period of four years failing to sell the script to various studios McLoughlin and Hawes found a group of Mormon investors who were willing to finance the film for one million dollars on the condition that they started filming in three weeks.
When searching for a lead actress to play the role of the film's heroine director McLoughlin had a specific vision for the film's heroine, "I wanted the classic beautiful blond geek girl who had a sense of innocence about her, and she was the one who was going to be tormented," he later recalled. After looking at actresses like Sharon Stone and Dominique Dunne, then 19-year-old actress Meg Tilly was cast for the role, and Batman actor Adam West was later cast for the role of the lead male character.
Filming took place in Los Angeles over a period of 28 days both on sets and on location with a budget of $800,000. The film's impressive special effects for the corpses used in the film were designed by Tom Burman along with several other artists. On filming in the actual mausoleum McLoughlin recalled, "In all those mausoleum scenes, Meg really got freaked out. She did not want to be there, and she allowed all that fear to work, even though we went into a set for some special effects sequences. She still carried the same vibe with her that she had in the mausoleum. She raised the bar in the film."
During the film's post production the film was taken out of McLoughlin's hands and re-cut with the original ending removed. As McLoughlin recalled, "There was a version of the movie that wasn't shown in theaters, where there was this passing of Ramar's energies to the Meg Tilly character... In our version, she turns and we actually used Nastassia Kinski's eyes from Cat People. There was this look that made them look dead and animal-like to give the audience this chill that it's not over. She got whatever Ramar had in her now".
The film, due to delays in post-production, finally achieved its release on February 25, 1983 and was released on VHS throughout the 1980s. Shriek Show released ''One Dark Night'' in January 2006.
Currently on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 44% audience score with an average rating of 3.1/5 based on 1,820 user reviews.
Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and called it a guilty pleasure that is horrible in an endearing way.

'''''Isle of the Snake People''''' is a 1971 Mexican horror film directed by Juan Ibáñez and starring Boris Karloff and Julissa. The film was produced by Ibanez for Azteca Films. The film was released as '''''La muerte viviente''''' in the United States as a Spanish-language film. It was later dubbed in English but received little theatrical distribution, and was then released for television. The film is also known as '''''Cult of the Dead''''' (in Hungary) and '''''Snake People''''' (in the United Kingdom).
Captain Labesch (Rafael Bertrand) arrives at a remote island, determined to crack down on the island's lawlessness, spurred by the voodoo rites practiced by the evil priest Damballah (Boris Karloff). Labesch starts with local tycoon Carl van Molder and his study of the island. Van Molder warns Labesch not to interfere with the local populace. Annabella (Julissa), van Molder's visiting niece, is a temperance crusader who wants her uncle to help fund the International Anti-Saloon League. She falls in love with handsome police lieutenant Andrew Wilhelm (Carlos East), despite his fondness for rum. Meanwhile, beautiful native girls are being transformed into zombies, and a sinister snake dancer named Kalea (Yolanda Montes) leads them to attack and devour any meddling policemen who get too close to their unholy rituals. In a dream, Annabella wakes up in a coffin. Another woman who looks like her is in a second coffin with a snake. The lookalike pursues and then kisses her. When Annabella is kidnapped and prepared to be the cult's latest human sacrifice, Labesch and Wilhelm have to infiltrate their ranks to save her, and they finally learn the secret identity of the all-powerful Damballah.

''Isle of the Snake People'' is one of four low-budget Mexican horror films Karloff made in a package deal with Mexican producer Luis Enrique Vergara, the others being ''The Incredible Invasion'', ''Fear Chamber'', and ''House of Evil''. With Karloff signed, Vergara obtained financing for the four films from Columbia Pictures, which would then distribute them. Karloff received $100,000 per film. Karloff initially rejected the scripts for all of the films, but agreed to them after they were rewritten by Jack Hill.
Filming was planned to take place in Mexico, but Karloff's emphysema prevented him from working at that altitude. Karloff's scenes in all four films were directed by Jack Hill at the Dored Studios in Los Angeles in the spring of 1968. Between shots, Karloff rested in a wheelchair. The films were then completed in Mexico at Studios America Mexico. Some additional scenes involving the van Molder character were filmed using a Karloff stand-in named Jerry Petty. Due to the unexpected death of Vergara, the release of the film was held up to determine ownership rights of inheritance under Mexican law. All four films in the package deal were released after Karloff's death in 1969.
The four Azteca Films productions for which Karloff shot his scenes in Los Angeles were released by Columbia Pictures over a two-year period after he had died in 1969.

'''''Sole Survivor''''' is an American 1983 horror film written and directed by Thom Eberhardt, in his feature film debut.
TV commercial producer Denise (Anita Skinner) emerges unscathed as the sole survivor of an airliner crash and feels as if she's about to be caught by something. Her doctor/boyfriend Brian (Ken Johnson) is convinced that she's experiencing "survivor's syndrome" in which sole survivors experience guilt and either commit suicide or put themselves in dangerous situations. Denise also receives some ambiguous warnings from psychic ex-actress Carla (Caren Larkey) who predicted the crash. A series of strange sightings and encounters of zombie-like people escalates until it is apparent that something is trying to kill her as people around her start dying as well. Her skeptical boyfriend thinks Denise is going crazy until he finds out that a number of recently dead people - including one that Denise claims attacked her - were found with all of the blood in their bodies drained into their legs as if they had died standing upright.
Plagued by night fears as well as a series of near-miss accidents that happen to her, Denise confides in her best friend and neighbor Kristy (Robin Davidson) about what is happening, but Kristy too remains skeptic. Denise becomes convinced that what is happening to her is supernatural in nature. Thinking that she was supposed to die in the air crash, Denise speculates that the specter of death is making people who have recently died come back to life and to stalk her before finding an opportunity to kill her to finish what the chain of events that began with the plane crash started.
One rainy evening, when a man, a health inspector who just died, breaks into Denise's house, he happens to find Kristy instead whom he kills by drowning. Denise walks in and barely escapes and calls the police who take her in for questioning only to find the man that Denise pointed who attacked her was found dead a short distance away and who had been dead for several hours. Also, Kristy's body is missing. When Brian talks with his pathologist friend Artie (William Snare) who tells him about irregular happenings in dead bodies (whom include a little girl, a homeless man, as well as the health inspector that attempted to kill Denise) had lividity of their blood draining into their legs as if they had been walking around after death, Brian begins to suspect that Denise might be telling the truth.
Meanwhile, the zombie Kristy murders a taxi driver who stops for her, and both of them attempt to kill Denise the following evening in her house. Brian arrives with a gun to attempt to stop them or help Denise, but he too ends up getting stabbed and killed by the undead Kristy. Denise manages to escape from her house, and drives through the nearby city which is deserted, but her car breaks down and she finds herself alone on the streets... aware that somewhere in a hospital or a morgue or a back alley that there is a person who has just died and will become a reanimated corpse for the sole purpose of killing her. The scared Denise manages to board a passing late-night bus and arrives at Carla's house with Brian's gun where she confides in Carla about what is going on and asks for help. But Carla, who has not spoken a word since Denise arrived at her house, takes the gun, revealing herself to be an undead cadaver having committed suicide minutes earlier by slashing her wrists in a bathtub, and shoots Denise dead before going back to the bathtub.
The final scene has Artie at the morgue with the bodies of Denise, Brian, Carla, Kristy and the taxi driver. Artie continues to be puzzled at how the blood in the bodies of the last three corpses drained into their legs. After talking to a skeptic police detective over the phone over the irregularity, Artie begins to finally suspect something strange is going on. In the final shot, as Artie begins to type out a report of his find, the bodies of Kristy and the others rise up from their slabs behind him to presumably kill him too to keep the supernatural events of the walking dead suppressed.

Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic Peter Dendle wrote that the film's East Asian mythology helps to distinguish it, but it "falls into the usual late-'80s horror ruts, preferring isolated shocks to any gradual build-up of mood".

'''''Return of the Moonwalker''''' is a 2011 feature-length comedy which parodies Michael Jackson with specific references to ''Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller'' and other Michael Jackson music videos. It was directed by Mike Maria, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Mike Moreau.
Count Cagliostro has sent his agents Gog and Magog to retrieve the gloved hand of Michael Jackson (promising them gay marriage and eternal life in return).  His plan is to resurrect the deceased pop star to lead a revolution which he feels will bring about peace on Earth.  His wife Sarafina is opposed to this plan and feels that the two immortals should instead be focused on keeping a low profile and maintaining their own immortality.  Despite her wishes Count Cagliostro manages to complete his ritual in preparation for a special performance at the punk circus that he has been using as a front for his sorcery.
Lesbian ghost hunters Raquel and Monique enter an underground chamber whose owner purports to have belonged to Adolf Hitler and claims is still inhabited by the former Nazi leader's ghost. After fleeing an attempted assault from this man the two girls manage to exit the labyrinth and happen upon the circus of Count Cagliostro.
Nico, T-Bag, and Obama are three young guys out getting drunk and causing trouble on the streets of Berlin when they get lured into a sex dungeon by Sarafina and her dominatrix friends.  After torturing the guys and extracting their semen for her husband's elixir of eternal life, she gives them free passes to Cagliostro's circus where they are joined by Raquel and Monique.
During the performance the audience is stunned into silence upon first hearing the voice and then seeing the risen Michael Jackson in the flesh.  He extends his hand to Raquel, but upon removing his glove she sees his exposed, decaying flesh.  Cagliostro immediately calls a stop to the performance and the ghost hunters and the guys hatch a plan to rescue Jackson from the sorcerer.
While escaping and being chased by skinheads, Muslim extremists, and neo-nazis, Jackson unites them all into a rainbow army which Cagliostro and Sarafina accidentally transform into an army of the undead, leaving only Raquel and Sarafina to stop them.

The character of Count Cagliostro was inspired by the 18th century occultist Alessandro Cagliostro. According to Director Mike Maria: "We wanted to do a satire, a crazy comedy about Cagliostro living again in Berlin, and he resurrects Michael Jackson because he's the only force who unite the masses, the left and the right." 
The film was directed by independent film director Mike Maria (who also played the role of Count Cagliostro) based on an original screenplay by Mike Maria and Mike Moreau (who also co-produced the movie). Chief photography was handled by the team of Andreas Thalhammer and Xiaosu Han who also worked on ''Lost Place 3D'', ''Asternauts'', and the Chinese film ''Runaway Woman''.
Over 105,000 people signed a petition in an attempt to prevent the release of ''Return of the Moonwalker'', which they felt was insulting to the memory of Michael Jackson.

Dead Kansas was filmed in Los Angeles, California, primarily around the San Fernando Valley. A portion was filmed at a circus-themed bar called, California Institute of Abnormalarts. It is located at 11334 Burbank Blvd, in North Hollywood, California 91601. Every room is decorated with an eclectic assortment of ugly dolls, strange wall hangings, clowns, skeletons, and other spooky Halloween themed relics. CIA almost has a museum-like feel. Production was permitted only 4 hours to film there.
Zombies are referred to as "Rottens" in ''Dead Kansas''. There is only one physical zombie, in full make-up, towards the end of the film. The other Rottens are never shown. They are only simulated via Point Of View (POV) in black & white. The camera acted as the Rotten's eyes in certain shots, while the actors reacted. As tempting as it was to use traditional make-up and show the Rottens, the director specifically chose POV to do something different. Dead Kansas is the first zombie film to extensively use POV.
The pilot of the webseries premiered on September 24, 2012 on YouTube. All five acts were eventually tied together and released on DVD as a full-length film in October 2013.  The film version of the series, screened at the 2014 FANtastic Horror Film Festival - where it won an award for Best Zombie Film.  Dead Kansas was released on Amazon Video, February 26, 2015.
The punk-rock music heard throughout the film is from the band Power Of Aggression. They are from the Hollywood area and were active during 1999 through the early 2000's. The band was originally called Gauntlet in the early-90's with former members Daniel Gallagher & Eddy Darbinian on guitars with Matthew Muller on bass guitar.  The band eventually reformed in 1999, changed their name to Power of Aggression and adopted most of the songs from Gauntlet. Original member and chief-songwriter Anthony Robinson played lead guitar & vocals, Adam Ledezma played drums and Aaron K. Carter played bass guitar on the soundtrack. When a soundtrack was needed, producers Aaron K. Carter and Adam Ledezma used the Power Of Aggression demo-tape that they recorded over a decade ago. The songs featured in Dead Kansas include: "The Ruler", "Walls Of Insanity", "Hate", "The Way We Feel", "Behold the Terror", and "Now".

 is a 2003 Japanese film directed by Yudai Yamaguchi. The film is written by Gataro Man, based on his manga series of the same name, and stars Tak Sakaguchi, Atsushi Ito, and Hideo Sakaki. It was produced by Ryuhei Kitamura.
The film is a combination of several genres, mixing martial arts action with the clichés of the sports film-particularly skewering baseball, one of Japan's most popular high school sports-and the violence and brutality of a horror film.  The film's bizarre-sometimes almost incoherent-plot, blood and gore, and unique comedy have given it something of a "cult" popularity in the West.
Though the film is ostensibly about high school baseball rivalries, the amount of actual baseball in the film is fairly light.  There are many scenes involving bats and balls, however.
The film was released on Region 1 DVD by Subversive Cinema.
It's every high school baseball team's dream to go to the legendary Koshien Stadium Tournament. For the first time in years, Seido High School has a chance—star player Gorrila Matsui has finally given the team an opportunity to succeed. Most delighted at this prospect is Principal Kocho. His hopes are dashed, however, when the Head teacher reveals to him that the first game will be played against the infamous Gedo High School."Head Teacher" is only ever referred to by this title. This title-in-place-of-name system is standard in the Japanese language
Gedo is notorious for its brutal killings during games. They hardly play at all, instead engaging in a form of martial arts combat called "fighting baseball". Their matches erupt into brutal battlefields, Gedo slaughtering its opponents in any way possible, and the competing team vainly struggling for their lives. The Gedo team is almost inhuman in its slaughter, and their bizarre weapons and attire coupled with their green-grey skin only increase this reputation. Understandably, Kocho is distressed—not only at the likely murder of his students, but at the loss of yet another chance to win the Koshien Stadium Tournament.
Much to his delight, however, is the appearance of mysterious newcomer Jubeh, played by Tak Sakaguchi. Jubeh rescues Four Eyes (Megane, so named because of his eyeglasses.), played by Atsushi Ito, from a gang of expelled students, beating Bancho (Japanese for "boss" or "leader") and catching Kocho's eye.During various points in the film, a crowd of people appears, usually engaging in spontaneous celebration or watching some event. Among the crowd is a schoolgirl dressed in a traditional ''sailor-fuku'', an injured man with a cast on his arm, and a nude man with his crotch covered by a fig leaf. According to the audio commentary included on the DVD release, the nude man is played by director Yudai Yamaguchi.Another recurring element in the film is a drunk man, usually seen laughing uproariously at whatever event has just occurred. He is always accompanied by his dog. At the end of the film, it is revealed through narration that the drunk died of alcohol poisoning during the final confrontation between the antagonists and protagonists. He also states that the drunk was "[his] master", implying that the dog has been the narrator of the entire film. Andy Klein of the ''L.A. City Beat'' called this the film's "best joke".  He begs and pleads with Jubeh to join the team to help them defeat Gedo, but he steadfastly refuses. During this time Kocho and Jubeh are also confronted by a resurrected Bancho, though his "face changed". Bancho joins the team, explaining that the injuries that prevented him from playing baseball were cured by Jubeh's punches.
When confronted by Four Eyes, Jubeh reveals why he has stopped playing baseball–in song. He musically laments his pitching skill, explaining how he became so skilled he was a danger to himself and others. Only his father, with an absurdly huge catcher's mitt, will allow Jubeh to pitch. However, when an accidental ball to the head kills him, Jubeh vows never to pitch again.
Despite this sorowful story, Four Eyes insists that Jubeh join the team, explaining his own plight. His mother hates baseball, and would be furious if he were to play. As a result, he must keep his presence on the Seido team a secret. Four Eyes' sheer love for the game touches Jubeh deeply, and he joins the team.
However, when the game against Gedo starts, Jubeh is nowhere to be found. As a result, the team is, predictably, slaughtered by the Gedo students. Jubeh gets there in time to hear Gorilla's last words.During this speech, the letters that make up the word "Seido" on Gorilla's uniform are strewn about to indicate the trauma that he has experienced. Finding a body he believes to be Four Eyes', Jubeh laments the loss, before realising that it's in fact a Gedo trap. The "body" explodes, hurling Jubeh across the field, sending him to an early grave.
Jubeh finds himself in a sepia-toned small town street in the afterlife. He sees a man he has not seen for some time–his father. He convinced Jubeh to embrace his pitching skills, and defeat Gedo once and for all. Jubeh pledges to do so as he watches his father ride off. Returning from the afterlife, he introduces his pitch, dubbed the "Super Tornado". Bancho also returns, again, this time as a child. He too met Jubeh's father in the afterlife, and was given his catcher's mitt.
In the meantime, somehow Four Eyes' mother has discovered that he was on the baseball team. As punishment, she locks him up in a cage, and watches over him day and night. Jubeh comes to rescue him, fighting Four Eyes's mother. He confronts her, asking her why she hates baseball so much. She reveals that her husband was killed by a baseball pitcher. All three come to a sudden realization—They are family. In jubilation, Four Eyes' mother gives him permission to play.
Kocho, Bancho, Jubeh, and Four Eyes, having formed a new Seido team, confront Gedo. The Gedo coach mocks the size and strength, or more accurately the lack thereof, of the new team. Much to his surprise however, several new team members show up—Head Teacher and Gorilla, now cyborgs, having been resurrected by "advanced technology", one of the school's cheerleaders, and Four Eyes' mother all team up to defeat Gedo.
Ultimately, all except Jubeh and the Gedo coach have been knocked unconscious. They duel with elaborate baseball bats, before Jubeh is knocked to the ground.  Then, the Gedo coach unveils his ultimate weapon: the Gedo Poison Bat. Filled with a combination of deadly poisons and healing herbs, the effect is to create a horrific pain that will last for "hundreds of years." The coach slams it down onto Jubeh—However, Four Eyes has sacrificed himself, jumping in the way of the coach's attack. Jubeh, furious at the loss of his brother, leaps up and bitterly attacks the coach. However, before he can kill the coach, the Gedo players plead for his life, explaining how he brought them out of orphanages and became like a father to them. Seeing their heartfelt plea, Jubeh can't help but allow the coach to live.
Happily, the coach gains a newfound respect for life, and throws a bottle of antidote to Jubeh. A crowd gathers, and the sun begins to shine. However, this peace is soon interrupted by one member of the Gedo team, his head wrapped in bandages. He guns down everyone on the field, firing randomly and hitting everything in sight, including his own teammates. Jubeh manages to escape only through his own dexterity and the gunman's limited ammo. Looking around in outrage, Jubeh sheds a tear. As cherry blossoms fall, everyone on the field returns to life, before Jubeh attacks the bandaged gunman, literally knocking the muscles off his bones.
Joyously, the crowd celebrates, and the narrator states that they lived happily ever after—Including the one person on the field that day who wasn't resurrected by Jubeh's tears.
The reaction to the film has been for the most part lukewarm. Though many praised its irreverent and unique style, others found the purposefully ludicrous plot hard to follow and indicative of a lack of effort on the screenwriter's part. However, the film did win the Grand Prize at the 14th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival held in February 2003. Director Yudai Yamaguchi was a guest at the festival.
The film has been compared with other Japanese films featuring baseball prominently. For instance, one reviewer compared it to 1992's ''Mr. Baseball'', explaining that it was better than that film due to a relative lack of actual baseball.. The parodic aspect of the film takes so much precedence that the clichés of baseball films are skewered more than baseball itself..
One of the key aspects of the film is its intentional strangeness. The strangest aspects of the plot (the frequent reappearances of a crowd and an alcoholic man, Head Teacher and Gorilla returning as cyborgs, etc.) are more prominent than the plot in the minds of most reviewers.Erik Lundergaar   from the Seattle Times.
Most reviewers agree that while the film is not necessarily high art, it is a good martial arts/horror/comedy film—they say that it is interesting and exciting enough to keep one watching until the end credits.. The film's humour is often highly praised, lightening up what would otherwise be a superficial and generic action film.Erik Henriksen.  from the Portland Mercury. The film has received some criticism, largely that it is ludicrous and "stupid", or that its plot does not sustain its length.Andy Klein.  , L.A. City Beat. However, others argue that this is not only irrelevant—The film is ''intended'' to be ludicrous and stupid—it is actually one of the strengths of the film.

'''''Black Sheep''''' is a 2006 New Zealand made black comedy horror film written and directed by Jonathan King. It was produced by Philippa Campbell and stars Nathan Meister, Peter Feeney, Danielle Mason, Tammy Davis, Oliver Driver, Tandi Wright, Glenis Levestam, Nick Blake, Matthew Chamberlain, Nick Fenton, Eli Kent, and Sam Clarke. The special effects were done by Weta Workshop.  
The film premiered at the TIFF on 10 September 2006 as part of their Midnight Madness series and was theatrically released on 29 March 2007 by The Weinstein Company in New Zealand.  
''Black Sheep'' received positive reviews from critics and grossed $4.9 million. It also received a Narcisse Award nomination for Best Feature Film.
A young Henry Oldfield (Nick Fenton) lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand, with his father and older brother, Angus. After witnessing his father's pride on Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident.  The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep.
Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a mutant lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep.
Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door. Tucker shoots the sheep. On the other end of the farm, Angus is driving around when he sees Grant. Grant bites Angus and runs off.
Back in the car, Tucker, Experience, and Henry leave to warn Angus about the killer sheep, but a sheep hiding in the car bites Tucker. After the car is destroyed, they seek refuge in the laboratory. Henry and Tucker finally realize that Angus is conducting cruel experiments. When one of the scientists see that Tucker's foot has now become a sheep's foot, she keeps him there for study but Experience and Henry escape when Angus cannot bring himself to shoot his own brother.
Suddenly, hordes of sheep come running down the hill. They see an offal pit surrounded by a gate. Henry accidentally slips into the pit, and his brother refuses to help. Henry and Experience fall into the pit but escape in the underground tunnels. Meanwhile, Tucker transforms into a sheep, but the scientist administers an injection of amniotic fluid from one of the mutant lambs which transforms him back to human. But when she goes to give the shot to Angus, she gets eaten by the sheep.
Angus gives a presentation to businessmen about his new genetically engineered sheep. The businessmen are soon slaughtered by the infected sheep. When Henry and Experience try to warn Angus, they discover he has a love for sheep. Disgusted, they leave. Henry realizes he has been infected so, like Angus, sheep no longer attack him. Henry and Experience go their separate ways. Henry ends up fighting with his brother, who has now transformed into a gargantuan sheep monster: however, only as intelligent as a sheep, Angus is kept in check by Henry and the farm's sheepdog. While he is cornered by the dog, the revolving propeller of the family plane cuts into Angus and wounds him badly.
Tucker suddenly arrives and disinfects Angus and Henry with more amniotic fluid, administered via a medicine nozzle designed for sheep. Experience arrives. Even though Angus is now a human, he goes back to the sheep and tells them to bite him again. The sheep, driven mad by the smell of blood, devour Angus. Eventually, all the sheep are contained and killed in a giant bonfire of ignited sheep flatulence. The cure is given to the surviving were-sheep people, including Grant. However, the sheepdog now makes sheep noises.

She has broken up with her zombie boyfriend Gonner, who desperately wants to get back together with her, and is no longer in contact with either Gonner or her mummy friend Isis.

She is worried over still having feelings for her former crush Ray, running for class president, her mother seeming intent on excluding Dixie's father from an upcoming Halloween party, and her mom's pushing her to stick with one type of social group rather than choosing her friends freely.
While she deals with her worries, Isis and Gonner return to ask for Dixie's help in restoring the powers of the Azoth once again, because Nebulosa has returned and there is a group of zombie-hunting boys out to destroy all zombies. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Dixie, Alyssa and Melissa are setting her up so they can ditch her and no one will be able to stand her afterward.

'''''Birdemic 2: The Resurrection''''' is a 2013 American romantic thriller-horror film written and directed by James Nguyen. It is the sequel to the 2008 film ''Birdemic: Shock and Terror''. The film, as with its predecessor, has been considered one of the worst films of all time and features mainly self-referential humor about the reception of the previous film. Taking place two years after ''Birdemic'', the film follows another mass bird attack caused by global warming, this time in Hollywood.
Bill (Thomas Favaloro), an independent film director, discovers waitress Gloria (Chelsea Turnbo) in a Hollywood eatery and casts her in the lead role of Kim in his new film, ''Sunset Dreams'', which is financed by his friend Rod (Alan Bagh), a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and Rod's wife, Nathalie (Whitney Moore). Shortly into production of ''Sunset Dreams'', a toxic rain falls on Hollywood which causes preserved killer birds and cavemen to emerge from the La Brea Tar Pits and zombies to come to life in a nearby cemetery. Bill, Gloria, Rod and Nathalie make their way around Hollywood with a dwindling band of survivors, fighting off the various threats before the birds eventually cease attacking and fly away.

''Birdemic 2'' was announced in April 2011, along with news that Bagh would reprise his role from the first film.
A tie-in video game was released in October 2012.
Dennis Harvey of ''Variety'' wrote, "Nguyen's partial self-awareness of his new movie's camp value ... only makes it an effortful, half-understood in-joke rather than the guiltily pleasurable unintentional joke that was ''Birdemic: Shock and Terror''."
In a 2016 Vice interview, Nguyen said that he is hoping to eventually make ''Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle'', which would be his last film. In October 2016, an Indiegogo campaign was raised in order to finance the third film of the series. The funding was eventually closed, with only roughly $600 out of the desired $500,000 raised.]: ''BIRDEMIC 3 - Sea Eagle'' fundraiser: BIRDEMIC 3 - Sea Eagle Indiegogo Fund Raising Campaign]

The original title, ''Volcano Zombies'', was changed to ''The Burning Dead'' for marketing reasons.  Perez endorsed the change.
Dominic Cuthbert of ''Starburst'' rated it 4/10 stars and wrote that both the script and acting are terrible, but it could have been salvaged if Perez had not taken himself so seriously.

While transporting toxic medical chemicals, a pair of truckers strike a deer and lose one of their canisters.  It rolls into a river, floats downstream, and splashes several beavers at their dam.  Later, college students Mary, Zoe, and Jenn arrive at Mary's cousin's cottage near the dam.  Although Zoe and Jenn are distraught that there is no cell phone coverage, Mary insists that they spend the next two days without interruptions from technology or boys.  While swimming at the lake, the girls discover the beaver dam.  When Jenn swims closer to see a beaver, they are surprised by a bear.  Smyth, a local hunter, scares off the bear and admonishes the girls to stay away from the beavers and dress more appropriately.
At night, the girls' boyfriends - Buck, Tommy, and Sam - arrive and play a prank on them.  Annoyed, Mary orders them to leave, but Zoe, who knew they were coming, insists they stay.  Jenn talks Mary into letting them stay, as she wants to resolve her relationship issues with Sam, who has cheated on her.  As the couples separate and have sex, Jenn leaves to take a shower, only to be attacked by a demonic mutated zombie beaver. Tommy kills it with a baseball bat, but Jenn and Mary feel something is wrong with it beyond rabies. They put the corpse in a bag and put it outside on the porch. In the morning, they discover it is missing, and Jenn insists that it was not merely eaten by wildlife.
All but Jenn go swimming in the lake. Sam and Mary discuss whether to tell Jenn about their affair, but they are interrupted when beavers chew off Buck's foot and scratch Tommy. The same beaver that attacked Jenn earlier chases her back to the house. She pins it to the counter with a knife, but not before it scratches her leg. Sam throws Zoe's dog into the water as a distraction, and the rest of the group flee to the house, where they realize the beavers have cut the phone lines. As zombie beavers surround the house, Tommy offers to leave with Buck to get help, and Zoe accompanies him. The beavers bring down a tree in the road, and Tommy sets off on foot, only to be crushed by another falling tree.
Smyth rescues Buck and Zoe, and they return to the house, which the others have boarded up. Unable to enter it, they go to the neighbors' house. They discover the neighbors are dead, and their phone lines dead. As a result of her wounds, Jenn turns into a beaver-like zombie and attacks Mary. As Jenn's saliva falls in Mary's mouth, Sam rescues Mary by hitting Jenn from behind and they lock her in a room. Meanwhile, Buck turns into a zombie and attacks Smyth. Zoe escapes by jumping through a window, bloodying herself in the process. Mary and Sam lock themselves in the bathroom and check each other for scratches. Satisfied that neither is wounded, they begin to have sex, but a zombie Jenn interrupts them and kills Sam by biting off his penis.  
As the cabin starts to go on fire caused by the beavers, Mary tries to leave, but is trapped by fire and beavers show up. She is then saved by Zoe who crashes through the cabin with Symth's truck and they drive off. Smyth, now zombified, shoots at them as they flee in his truck. Jenn jumps on top the truck, but Zoe runs her over. Together, Mary and Zoe reach the spot where Tommy died and turned into a zombie. With the road blocked, they decide to walk. Believing that Zoe may be bitten due to her bloody appearance, Mary holds her at gunpoint with a pistol recovered from Smyth's truck. As Zoe protests that she is not infected, Mary begins changing into a zombie. Zoe kills her with an axe and walks away. On the road, she encounters the same truckers who had earlier dropped the canister, and they run over her accidentally. Since it cuts to black before they hit her it's unknown if this kills her or just injures her. In a post-credits sequence, a honeybee becomes infected from a corpse and returns to its hive in a zombified state possibly infecting the other bees.

Al Kaplan, Jordan Rubin, and Jon Kaplan began working on the script for ''Zombeavers'' in 2012.
The film had its world premiere on April 19, 2014, at the Tribeca Film Festival and was theatrically released in the U.S. on March 20, 2015. 
In December 2014, the film was released on DVD.
Rotten Tomatoes reports that 69% of 32 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.7/10.  The consensus reads: "''Zombeavers'' obviously isn't high art, but it delivers just enough of the gory insanity promised by the title to earn a recommendation for genre fans." and Jason Gorber of Twitch Film "commend[s] its tenacious nature to mine every last drop of narrative and complexity out of a very slight but very funny idea." On the other hand, ''Variety'' gave ''Zombeavers'' a mostly negative review, commenting that "this debut feature for standup and sketch-comedy vet Rubin is not without flashes of ingenuity, but the one-joke premise wears thin even before the mercifully brief 76-minute running time is up." However, the critic adds that "''Zombeavers'' is not a total wash, and seen at night, under the right combination of low expectations and controlled substances, it may even seem better than it really is."
''Zombeavers'' was released in Austria on November 7, 2014, where it grossed $29,133. for a total worldwide gross of $44,080.
The soundtrack was composed by Al and Jon Kaplan.  It features songs from the Kaplan brothers' band Legolambs.

'''''Survival of the Dead''''' (also known as '''''George A. Romero's Survival of the Dead''''') is a 2009 American horror film written and directed by George A. Romero and starring Alan van Sprang, Kenneth Welsh and Kathleen Munroe. It is the sixth entry in Romero's Night of the Living Dead (film series)|''Night of the Living Dead'' series. The story follows a group of AWOL National Guardsmen who briefly appeared in ''Diary of the Dead''.
The prologue follows the actions of National Guard Sergeant "Nicotine" Crockett, who along with Kenny, Francisco and Tomboy, desert their posts and rob the protagonists of the previous film. Meanwhile, off the coast of Delaware lies Plum Island, home to two feuding Irish families: the O'Flynns and the Muldoons. The former family, led by Patrick O'Flynn, round up a posse to kill the undead on the island. O'Flynn learns that the Muldoons are keeping their undead loved ones safe until a cure is found. Tensions come to a head when O'Flynn and his posse arrive at a Muldoon house to dispatch their undead children, only to engage in a brief gunfight that leaves a woman dead as well.  Unable to put the children down himself, Patrick surrenders his weapons when the Muldoon posse arrives.  Seamus Muldoon contemplates killing Patrick until Patrick's daughter Janet suggests he be exiled from the island instead.
Boy joins the National Guardsmen and through him they learn of Plum Island. They watch a video made by Patrick O'Flynn and follow the instructions in it that leads them to a nearby dock.  At the dock, O'Flynn and his men attempt to rob the Guardsmen, which results in a shootout.  Francisco steals a ferry boat and bites off the finger of an attacking zombie in the process. All of the O'Flynns but Patrick are killed by zombies, and he boards the ferry. During the trip to the island, Patrick says that he sent other people to Plum Island to anger the Muldoons.
When the group reach the island they discover that the Muldoons have chained up their zombies in imitations of their previous lives. They also see that the people sent to the island by Patrick have been killed. Patrick sees his daughter Janet ride by on a horse, apparently dead and turned into a zombie.  Patrick attempts to gather allies when two Muldoons attack them, shooting Crockett and Kenny. The latter dies from his wounds, and is shot in the head by Patrick to prevent reanimation. Francisco realizes that he infected himself when bit off the zombie's finger and asks Tomboy to shoot him to keep him from turning. Tomboy shoots him and is then captured by Muldoon.
Patrick finds out that the daughter he saw earlier was actually Janet's twin sister Jane. Janet, still alive, joins Patrick and the Guardsmen in their attack on the Muldoons. A standoff occurs at the bridge that separates the two families' land, and the O'Flynn group is captured; Boy and Janet escape. Muldoon reveals his attempts to persuade the zombies to eat something other than human flesh and uses Jane as a test case. He tries to persuade the dead woman to bite her horse, but instead she attacks and bites her sister Janet. A melee ensues and captured zombies are released, consuming people from both sides. Muldoon and O'Flynn call a truce that is almost immediately broken when Muldoon shoots O'Flynn, who pulls a hidden gun and kills Muldoon.
Crockett and his group attempt to leave the island. Janet witnesses her sister bite the horse and rushes to tell Crockett's group the news.  Patrick shoots his daughter to prevent her turning before he succumbs to his own wounds. Crockett, Boy, and Tomboy board the ferry and escape the island while the zombies are eating the horse. Crockett muses about the purpose of war as the reanimated O'Flynn and Muldoon stagger toward each other and attempt to shoot and kill the other again.

'''''Colin''''' is a 2008 British zombie film written and directed by Marc Price. After a successful run in a number of film festivals, it went on to be shown at Cannes in 2009. Applauded for its success despite its low budget, the total cost of production was reportedly £45. The director, actor and comedian Marc Price, shot ''Colin'' on a standard definition Panasonic mini-dv camcorder that he had owned for 10 years and edited the film on his home PC using Adobe Premiere 6 software which had come bundled with a video capture card he'd purchased a few years earlier. Facebook and Myspace were used to gather actors to play the zombies.
Injured in the arm, Colin arrives home to the house he shares with Damien only to find it empty. While cleaning his wound in the kitchen sink, he is attacked by Damien, now a zombie. He manages to "kill" Damien by stabbing him multiple times in the head with a kitchen knife, but soon afterwards becomes a zombie himself. Now one of the undead, Colin wanders the streets of London during the onset of a probable zombie apocalypse. He acquires the usual zombie cannibal taste for human flesh but avoids conflict. While being mugged for his trainers, he is seen by Linda, his sister. That evening zombies invade a house party and kill everyone within. Colin follows the sole survivor of the carnage (who, we later discover, reminds him of Laura, his friend) before she is trapped by a madman / serial killer in his basement with a group of blinded zombies.
Linda and a friend finally capture Colin and take him to their mother's house, but Colin cannot recognize them. Linda has already been bitten by Colin when trying to save him from the muggers, and turns into a zombie, while she is reanimating she is locked in with Colin and her boyfriend and mother leave. Colin and Linda shamble away. The film also follows a cowering group of human survivors who finally go on the offensive. Led by Slingshot guy, the humans attack a large group of zombies with a makeshift grenade, which explodes near Colin, destroying most of his face. Three of the humans are bitten during the fight and are brutally killed by the rest of the group after one starts turning.
Colin survives and finds his way to his friend Laura's home, where the film cuts to a flashback to when he was still human. Arriving at the house, he discovered that Laura had trapped a zombie in the bathroom. While attempting to kill the zombie, she was bitten and died in his arms, before reanimating and biting him. He then killed her before going home, which brings the viewer back to the film's beginning.Michael Brooke: "Review: Colin:" Sight and Sound: November 2009: 19:11: 52-53

'''''Maggie''''' is a 2015 post-apocalyptic horror drama film directed by Henry Hobson, in his directorial debut, written by John Scott 3, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Abigail Breslin and Joely Richardson. ''Maggie'' is a dramatic departure for Schwarzenegger, who is more known for his action film roles.
The film was originally set to have its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, but Lionsgate bought the American distribution rights and pulled the film out of the festival's roster. It instead premiered at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival on April 23, 2015, as part of their lineup, followed by a limited theatrical release and simultaneous VOD release on May 8, 2015.
In the present-day Midwestern United States, society struggles to function in the aftermath of a zombie pandemic barely under control (Necroambulism). Maggie Vogel (Abigail Breslin) calls her father from a broken city under curfew; her voicemail urges that he not seek her and that she loves him. Her arm was bitten. Knowing she has only weeks before the "Necroambulist virus" turns her cannibalistic, she left home to protect her family. Maggie's father Wade (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has searched two weeks, despite her warning. Finding her in a hospital for the infected, he brings Maggie home to care for her until she must eventually be quarantined. During their return, a zombie attacks Wade at an abandoned gasoline station and he breaks its neck.
At home, Maggie's younger half-siblings Bobby and Molly (Aidan and Carsen Flowers) are leaving to stay with their aunt. Maggie talks to Bobby, who mostly understands what she is undergoing. She withdraws from her family, struggling to cope with her hopeless situation and torn about contacting her friends. Falling from a swing, she breaks a finger on her infected arm, from which black fluid oozes. Terrified, even though she feels little or no pain, and despairing over her deteriorating body, Maggie cuts off the finger. She flees outside and encounters a neighbor, Nathan, and his young daughter, both senseless with infection. Wade kills both zombies but feels extreme remorse. The responding sheriffs consider Wade blameless, instead blaming Nathan's wife Bonnie, who hid her infected family from the authorities. Bonnie visits Wade that night, decrying the dehumanizing treatment of the infected and revealing that Nathan had locked himself in with his sick daughter, becoming infected himself, rather than abandon her to death among strangers in quarantine.
A doctor warns Wade that Maggie's condition is worsening quickly, leaving him three eventual options: she can be quarantined, which Wade refuses; Wade can administer at home the same euthanasia injection offered in quarantine, which he's warned is painful; or Wade can "make it quick" himself. Wade and Maggie make the most of their remaining days, reminiscing about Maggie's deceased mother. Despite Maggie's physical deterioration (she's woken by maggots wriggling in her dying arm) she struggles to maintain normality. She attends a bonfire with high school friends Allie and an infected boy, Trent (Bryce Romero), whom Maggie previously dated, and whom she kisses. He tells rumors of horrible conditions at the quarantine facilities, saying he would die before going there.
One day, Maggie smells food near her stepmother Caroline (Joely Richardson), though Caroline smells nothing and muses that Wade must be cooking downstairs. Finding the kitchen empty, Caroline realizes in horror that Maggie has begun to smell living flesh, in this case Caroline's, as food. Maggie receives a desperate call from Trent. At his home, Trent has locked himself inside his bedroom after he too felt hunger smelling another human. Maggie tries to comfort him but watches helplessly as the police forcibly remove Trent to quarantine.
Back home, Maggie encounters a trapped fox in the woods. Later she runs into her home, hysterical and coated in blood, admitting through tears to her frightened parents that she freed the fox but then couldn't stop herself from attacking it. Wade shoots the half-eaten fox. Caroline departs and urges Wade it's time Maggie is taken away. Two officers arrive and Wade fights one of them before Maggie appears, assuring them she has not yet turned. The sympathetic sheriff leaves Wade with a warning that he'd better decide what to do with her before they next come to check on Maggie.
Wade shows Maggie white daisies he's grown in her mother's old garden, "Daisy" being a nickname he sometimes uses for Maggie. She thanks him for the garden's beauty, but also begs him to promise that he will "make it stop" before she grows worse. Later, Wade sits alone with his shotgun, still unable to use it. He pretends to sleep when Maggie approaches, her skin now gray and her eyes blackened. She lingers over him, smelling him, seemingly on the edge of self-control, before kissing his forehead. She then climbs to the roof and jumps off, her last memories being of herself as a child frolicking outdoors with her mother, picking a daisy.

The original screenplay for ''Maggie,'' written by John Scott 3, won the Thriller/Horror category Gold Prize in the 2010 PAGE International Screenwriting Awards competition, and as a result was brought to the attention of director Henry Hobson.  The following year, the script landed on the Black List of "most liked scripts."  Chloë Grace Moretz was initially attached to the project but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The film's shooting schedule lasted 25 days.  Hobson produced more than 200 pages of storyboards to guide his actors throughout the film.
On March 25, 2015, the trailer for ''Maggie'' was released on YouTube, receiving 4 million hits in 4 days, Limited edition posters were also produced for the US market https://twitter.com/henryhobson/status/599337370702454784
''Maggie'' premiered at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival on April 22, 2015.
Although ''Maggie'' received mixed reviews, critics praised Schwarzenegger's and Breslin's performances.
Christopher Bourne of Twitch Film, reviewing from the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival, states that Schwarzenegger "delivers one of his finest and most effective performances here, the most dialed back and restrained he's ever been. He brings surprising nuance and depth to his role as a father who desperately fights to preserve his last moments with his daughter, and who suffers considerable agony at his inability to reverse or ameliorate Maggie's inevitable decline", and adds that his dramatic turn "suggests his capability for a wider range of roles as he approaches his seventies and is less able to take on the physical demands of the action hero roles that he has been known for."
Perri Nemiroff of Collider.com, who gave the film a mixed review, notes that Schwarzenegger "won't ever completely shake the super tough exterior, but he certainly comes across as a very relatable, loving father here", and that Breslin "gets a nice assist from the eerily natural zombie transformation makeup, but it's her ability to move between selling Maggie as a strong young woman trying to keep it together for her family and also being downright terrified that makes the performance especially heart wrenching." However, she ultimately states that the film "is just one big missed opportunity. [director] Hobson's certainly got potential, but his determination to highlight the characters' misery through dim visuals and super sad faces winds up completely sucking the life out of the concept."
Grayson Hamilton of Popzara.com was more enthusiastic than most, saying the film "regains speed and ends at the perfect moment, without need to pander to the audience or stretch for a longer screen time", while adding "the level of emotional heft is rare for a Schwarzenegger film, but the action icon carries it better than any other performance of his entire career." 
Drew McWeeny of Hitfix.com provides an overall negative review of the film, saying of Schwarzenegger's role, "we finally have a real performance to judge as Arnold is stripped of pretty much everything he's ever been able to rely on in his work. The result is a close-up study of his limitations as an actor, and a genuinely sad piece of work that he handles well." McWeeny also comments, "Breslin does solid work as a girl who has to grapple with the idea that she will not be able to enjoy the joys of adulthood, and who knows full well what her suffering is going to do to her father.... I honestly wish I liked the film more, but at this point, we've seen a whole lot of zombie movies, and while this one tries to find a new way into the idea, it doesn't do anything particularly new."

'''''Remains''''', also billed as '''''Steve Niles' Remains''''', is a 2011 post-apocalyptic horror film.  It depicts a small group of people in a Reno, Nevada casino who have survived a nuclear disaster while the rest of humanity has been turned into flesh eating zombies.  It was produced by the Chiller Network and is based on the comic book series of the same name.
Tom (Grant Bowler) and Tori (Evalena Marie) are employees at the fictional Silver Star Casino in Reno, Nevada|Reno.  On a slow day at the tables, Tom convinces Tori to join him in a stock room for a sexual encounter.  At the same time a news report is airing about "Peace Day", a day when the entire world's supply of nuclear weapons is set to be destroyed.  Something goes wrong during the event and a nuclear blast occurs, knocking out power to the casino and trapping Tom and Tori behind an electronic lock.  When the power is restored they find the casino trashed and people gone, except for an old lady in a power chair who attacks Tori.  After dispatching the old lady with a chair leg, they encounter magician's assistant Jensen (Miko Hughes).  He tells them that he turned the power back on and that he isn't sure what happened.  Tom and Jensen go up front to check the casino security cameras while Tori goes to the front door to look outside.  Tom and Jensen see Victor (Anthony Marks) outside throwing a man to the zombies to save himself.  Victor bolts into the casino and demands to be let in.  Jensen lets him in and takes him to a bathroom to clean up while Tom and Tori decide to start trapping the other zombies in the casino.
The survivors trap zombies in various parts of the hotel and dispose of the dead off the hotel dock.  They note that at night the zombies appear to be sleeping.  They spend the next few days drinking, smoking, and playing cards to kill time.  While on the roof, Tom spots a convoy of trucks but drops his radio off the roof before he can contact them.  Deciding to use a spotlight from across the street to attract the convoy, they head out at night past the sleeping zombies.  When the light is turned on music plays with it, waking the zombies.  The group is separated, with Victor running back into the casino and Tom and Tori trapped on a bus.  The army convoy arrives, rescuing Tom and Tori and taking shelter with them in the casino.  The army's medic, Cindy (Tawny Cypress), patches up Tom's hand and tells them that the group is headed to Lake Tahoe, California|Lake Tahoe.  Jensen begins sneaking around and discovers that the army has taken all of the food and supplies from the casino with the help of Victor.  He confronts the soldiers on the dock and a shootout occurs, killing Jensen.  The army decides to leave immediately, but Tom stalls them by asking if they cleared out the pantry beyond the banquet hall.  The soldiers force Tom to show them where it is, and he opens the door to release dozens of zombies that he and Tori trapped in the room earlier.  The zombies overwhelm the soldiers, who flee the casino in a panic.  
Tom and Tori make an attempt to escape in a car from the parking garage but cannot get the door open.  After returning to the roof they spot Cindy returning in a pickup truck, which she rolls over in a crash when a zombie surprises her.  Tom rescues Cindy and brings her back inside, where Tori threatens to shoot her.  Cindy tells them that the convoy was attacked by a herd of faster, stronger zombies and that no one survived.  Tori and Cindy argue and Tori taunts Cindy about her father's death.  She then tells Cindy that Tom killed someone in a drunk driving accident in Vegas.  Later on, while eating, Tom reveals to Cindy that he killed his wife and unborn child in the accident.  They decide to travel to Carson City, Nevada|Carson City to try to find Cindy's daughter.  In the morning, Tom and Cindy head to the roof to see that the herd of stronger zombies has arrived.  At the front entrance, the stronger zombies are breaking down the barricade.  Tom, Tori, and Cindy decide to try to use the explosives to escape.  They open all the gas lines on the kitchen stoves and set a charge.  As they are escaping Cindy is attacked and breaks her ankle.  Tori tries to convince Tom to leave Cindy behind and when he refuses she hits him in the head with an axe, takes his gun, and leaves.  Tori sets an explosive charge on the garage door and is attacked by a zombie.  The zombie bites her but is killed in the blast.  A dazed Tori wanders into the street and is swarmed by zombies.  Tom and Cindy make it to the exit as the second explosive charge goes off, destroying most of the hotel and casino.  They make it to the parking garage where they find the door blasted open.  They find the Smart Car that Tori and Tom tried to escape in earlier and use it to leave the casino.  In the final scene, a zombified Tori carries her shotgun and kills the weaker zombies--implying that she is stronger, faster, and still retains her human intelligence--and looks toward the direction where Tom and Cindy drove.

Rick Albert and executive producer Mark Amin decided that their first film production should be a genre film, using as many special effects and monsters as the small $250,000 budget could support.  To save costs, Rick Albert recruited many of his friends, who were lawyers, to appropriately play the army of zombies.  The film was edited on a movieola using 35 mm film.
The film was produced by Richard L. Albert through his motion picture design and marketing firm, Design Projects Inc..  Financing was provided by the individual owners of Trimark Pictures which was then called Vidmark.
The film was shot mostly in Topanga Canyon in Los Angeles, with the final scene shot at Bronson Caves in Griffith Park.

'''''Day of the Dead''''' is a 1985 American horror film written and directed by George A. Romero and the third film in Romero's Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|''Dead'' series, being preceded by ''Night of the Living Dead'' (1968) and ''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978).
Romero describes the film as a "tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society".http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DayoftheDead
This film features Sherman Howard in an early appearance as Bub, and make-up artist Gregory Nicotero playing Private Johnson and assisting Tom Savini with the make-up effects.
Cannibalistic zombies have overrun the entire world. The remaining fragments of the U.S. government and military hide out in fortified military bases and colonies, attempting to find a solution to the zombie pandemic. Dr. Sarah Bowman (Lori Cardille), Private Miguel Salazar (Anthony Dileo Jr.), radio operator Bill McDermott (Jarlath Conroy), and helicopter pilot John (Terry Alexander) fly from their underground base to Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They encounter a large horde of the undead, and return to their army base in the Everglades, where a small group of scientists, supported by a skeleton crew of soldiers, is searching for a way to cope with the zombie problem.
Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty), the lead scientist - also known as "Frankenstein" due to his grisly surgical dissections of zombies  - believes that the zombies can be trained to become docile, and accordingly has amassed a collection of test subjects, which are kept in a large underground corral in the compound, in spite of the objections of Captain Rhodes (Joseph Pilato). The tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, loss of communication with other survivors, and slow progress in research. During a meeting between the scientists and the soldiers, Rhodes announces that, following the death of the previous base commander Major Cooper, he is taking command of the base, that the scientists henceforth will work under his orders, and that anyone who objects will instantly be killed. Dr. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes' cooperation by showing him the results of his research. He is especially proud of "Bub", a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and engages in rudimentary human behavior: listening to music, aiming a pistol, and saluting Captain Rhodes. "Civility must be rewarded," Logan says. "If it's not rewarded, there's no use for it. There's just no use for it at all!"  Rhodes is not impressed.
During a zombie roundup mission, two of the soldiers, Miller and Johnson, are killed after a zombie escapes its harness; whereupon Miguel attempts to kill the creature, but is bitten on the arm. Sarah amputates the arm and cauterizes it to stop the spreading infection. Rhodes then calls off the experiments and demands that all captive zombies be destroyed. Sarah and Bill later discover a crude form of Dr. Logan's experimentation involving the bodies of Miller and Johnson and an audio tape in which a crazed Logan talks to his "Father" and "Mother"; horrified, both Sarah and Bill plan to leave in the helicopter immediately before someone else does.
Conditions worsen further when Rhodes finds out that Logan has been feeding the flesh of his dead soldiers to Bub as a reward for his docility and positive behavior. Enraged, Rhodes kills Logan and his assistant Dr. Fisher. He then locks Sarah and Bill inside the zombie corral and attempts to force John to fly him and his men away from the base, which John refuses to do.
Bub manages to escape from his chain and finds Dr. Logan's corpse. In a display of human emotion, he expresses sadness and then becomes enraged. He finds a pistol discarded on the floor and goes in search of revenge. Meanwhile, Miguel, who has become suicidal, opens the gates to the compound, allowing the horde of zombies lurking outside to enter onto the elevator, devouring him. While Miguel is doing this, John overcomes his captors, knocking both Rhodes and Torrez out before stealing their weapons and going into the zombie corral to rescue Sarah and Bill. The zombies rapidly enter the complex; Pvt Rickles and Pvt Torrez are torn apart by the horde. Pvt Steel attempts to shoot Bub through a covered window, but gets bitten by another zombie and chooses to kill himself rather than be eaten alive. Rhodes attempts to escape, but is shot and wounded by Bub and then violently torn apart into pieces by a crowd of zombies, killing him.
John reunites with Sarah and McDermott inside the zombie corral. They escape together to the surface, board the helicopter, and fly to a deserted island with no dead people or zombies on it. The film ends with Sarah crossing off a day on her calendar which counts the days since their escape from the compound.

Romero originally intended the film to be "the ''Gone with the Wind'' of zombie films". Following budget disputes and the artistic need to release the film unrated, the budget of the film was cut in half, dropping from $7 million to a scant $3.5 million. This forced Romero to scale back his story, rewriting the script and adjusting his original vision to fit the smaller budget.
A total of five scripts were written as Romero wrestled with the film's concepts and the budgetary constraints. The first draft was over 200 pages, which he later condensed to 122 pages. This is the true original script, and to date copies of it have not come to light. This version was likely rejected because UFDC felt it was too expensive for them to produce even with an R rating. Romero subsequently scaled down the scope of this script into a 165-page draft (often erroneously referred to as the original version), then condensed it again to a 104-page draft labeled the 'second version, second draft' in an unsuccessful final attempt to get the story within budget parameters. When this failed, he drastically altered the original story concept and ultimately produced a shooting draft that numbered only 88 pages.
Filming took place in the fall of 1984 at locations in Pennsylvania and Florida. All above-ground scenes were filmed at several locations around Florida, where Romero was living at the time. The opening scene was filmed in Fort Myers, Florida. The fenced in compound with the helicopter landing pad was shot at a location called Bowman's Beach Helistop in Sanibel.  Underground scenes were filmed in a former mine shaft located near Wampum, Pennsylvania, converted into a long-term storage facility for important documents. Though the mine maintained a constant temperature of about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, its high humidity played havoc with the crew's equipment and props. Mechanical and electrical failures were a constant problem throughout filming, and caused several of special effects leader Tom Savini's props to fail during the filming. Despite these failures, Savini was nominated and won the 1985 Saturn Award for best makeup effects. The remote location also complicated the transportation of crew members and equipment. Cast and crew would often sleep in the mine overnight to avoid the time-consuming travel to and from the shooting location. "Zombie" extras were recruited from among the citizens of Pittsburgh, with preference given to those who had worked on previous Romero films. Extras were paid $1.00 for their services, and given a hat that read "I was a Zombie in Day of the Dead".
The film was given a very limited release. This is chronicled in the documentary "The Many Days of Day of the Dead" on the two-disc Anchor Bay special edition DVD of the film. Some of the original concepts and characters remain, but the film differs greatly from Romero's original script, as stated by actress Lori Cardille:
Joseph Pilato was cast as Rhodes, the film's antagonist. As stated by Pilato "He pretty much just gave it to me. I don't know if he auditioned other people, but it was very quick. I came in and it was like, "You got it!." Pilato had acted in two prior films directed by Romero, the first being Pilato's debut ''Dawn of the Dead'' and the second being ''Knightriders'', in between those films he played his first lead role in a film entitled ''Effects''. In an interview Pilato was asked if Romero "had him in mind", Pilato stated that one of the reasons why he got the role was because of the budget being scaled down from 7 to 3.5 million.
Subsequent to its theatrical release, the film has grossed over 30 million dollars worldwide. ''Day of the Dead'' would earn most of its gross revenue when the film was released internationally on VHS format, and later DVD and Blu-ray.  This is in contrast to the film's poor box-office reception when it was released in cinemas.

Near the end of the film version of ''Resident Evil'', the protagonist Alice walks outside of her quarantine into a ravaged city street jammed with traffic. The camera pans past a newspaper blowing in the wind stating "The Dead Walk!", a direct homage to George Romero's work on ''Day of the Dead''. Another homage is one episode of Stroker and Hoop|Stroker & Hoop featured the characters battling zombies using guns made by Double-Wide. They turn out to fire only sunlight, which he claims is because of zombies' vulnerability to sunlight, hinted at by the film being called ''Night of the Dead'' and not ''Day of the Dead''. Coroner Rick yells at him "That was the sequel!"
The song "M1 A1", from the Gorillaz (album)|self-titled 2001 Gorillaz album samples the pulsing synthesizers and cries of "Hello! Is anyone there?" from the opening of the film. The song "Hip Albatross", also by Gorillaz, features a clip of Terry Alexander's dialogue.
The song "Battlefield", from the This Is My Battlefield 2004 Panzer AG album samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in reference to Miguel's zombie bite: "You think he wants to walk around after he's dead? You think he wants to be one of these things?" The line "Sit down or so help me god I'll have you shot" appears once near the end of the song.
The band Through the Eyes of the Dead sampled a clip at the beginning of the song "Between the Gardens that Bathe in Blood", released on the Scars of Ages EP.
The Ministry song "Burning Inside" (from the album ''The Mind Is a Terrible Thing To Taste'') features an audio sample of the military station's warning horn and a few notes of composer John Harrison's synthesized score.
The song "Confessions of a Knife (theme part 2)," from the 1990 album ''Confessions of a Knife...'' by My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult samples dialogue between Sarah and Captain Rhodes: Captain Rhodes: "I'll have you shot."
Sarah: "Are you out of your mind?"
Captain Rhodes: "No, ma'am.  Are you?"
Along with dialogue from private Steele and laughter from private Rickles that repeats later throughout the song.
Steele: "Bang! You're dead!" followed by Rickles' laughter.
The song "The Only Good God Is a Dead God," from the 1992 album ''Psychological Warfare Technology Systems'' by Terror Against Terror,  samples Captain Rhodes' final screams "Choke on them... choke on them," with the sounds of the zombies eating him.
American punk band the Misfits recorded a song about the film entitled "Day of the Dead" for their 1997 album ''American Psycho''.
Bub the Zombie makes a cameo appearance in ''The Walking Dead'' season 4 episode "Us", as one of the walkers encountered by the characters Glenn and Tara in a railroad tunnel, an homage to not only the character but also to the underground setting of "Day of the Dead". In the same season, a zombie rolls out of bed and has its guts fall out, resembling a scene from the movie.
Seattle-based musical duo Little Black Bottles composed "Letter to Miguel", a tribute song to character Miguel Salazar, for their album ''Let Them Eat Red Velvet Cake''.
The soundtrack was released on LP and cassette in the same year as the film (1985) by Saturn Records; it contained 6 tracks, all of which was composed and performed by John Harrison. The vocals came from Sputzy Sparacino who was the lead singer of ''Modern Man'' and Gospel Singer, Delilah on the tracks "If Tomorrow Comes" and "The World Inside Your Eyes". The album was re-issued in 2002 by Numenorean Records as a limited edition CD.  The new edition was limited to 3000 copies and contained the original album plus five additional tracks from the music and effects reel (the only surviving recording of the film score).  It also included a 12-page booklet with information from Harrison and Romero regarding the score.
A half prequel, half sequel was released in 2005, entitled ''Day of the Dead 2: Contagium''. Although it is, by definition, an official sequel as Taurus Entertainment Company holds the rights to the original film, no one from the original ''Day of the Dead'' had any involvement in the film.
A loose remake of the film, ''Day of the Dead'', was released straight to DVD on April 8, 2008. This marks the second time that Ving Rhames makes an appearance in a remake of a George A. Romero zombie film, following ''Dawn of the Dead''.
On July 10, 2013 it was announced that there would be another remake of ''Day of the Dead''. Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman, two of the producers behind ''Texas Chainsaw 3D'' have obtained the rights. Campbell, who had a small role in the first remake said "We want to keep it as close to the Romero version as possible. To make sure that his fans are happy. These are not going to be zombies climbing walls and doing back flips like in ''World War Z''." Campbell and Grobman are currently holding meetings with possible writers to figure out the best way to adapt the story. It began filming in June 2016.
In 2014, Sherman Howard's zombie character Bub appeared in a cameo in the fifteenth episode of Season 4 of the AMC series ''The Walking Dead''.
Members of the band NRBQ appear as zombies in the film.  For the day they were on set, they were paid a dollar and a sandwich.
Stef Hutchinson wrote the 24-page comic ''Day of the Dead: Desertion'', which was exclusively released to celebrate the movie's 25th anniversary and shows the origins of Bub, before becoming a Zombie.

'''''Plague''''' is a 2014 Australian horror film directed by Kostas Ouzas and Nick Kozakis, written by Ouzas, and starring Tegan Crowley, Scott Marcus, and Steven Kennedy.  After a Zombie#Zombie apocalypse|zombie apocalypse, Evie (Crowley) and her husband John (Marcus) struggle to survive on their own.  They receive help in the form of a resourceful stranger, Charlie (Kennedy), who shows up one day and offers to assist them.  It had a private screening at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne on 29 October 2014 and premiered at the Fantastic Planet Sci-Fi, Horror, and Fantasy Film Festival on 22 November.
Society breaks down after a virus causes the infected to turn into cannibalistic killers.  When Evie's husband John becomes separated from the rest of the group during an attack, the survivors fall back to their emergency shelter.  Gary and Evie want to wait for John, as they all agreed they would do in such a circumstance, but Bob becomes increasingly impatient.  Citing the realities of the situation, Bob says they must assume John is dead and leave for a more permanent shelter.  Although Bob backs down, he later takes the group's car, rifle, and supplies by force.  When Gary objects, Bob kills him.  Sammy, the group's mechanic, and Marge, Bob's wife, leave with him; Evie stays behind by herself to wait for John.
When John finally arrives, he is angered to find that Evie has allowed the others to leave with all their supplies.  Evie's protestations are cut short when Sammy returns on foot, delirious and obviously infected.  John shoots her as she begins to transform.  John and Evie attempt to survive on their own but are besieged by zombies.  As John is about to commit suicide, a stranger named Charlie saves them.  John greets Charlie with suspicion and explains they have nothing he can steal.  When Charlie explains he wants nothing more than their companionship and offers to share his supplies, Evie welcomes him.  As the three come to trust each other, John explains that he is a former college professor and Evie is a schoolteacher.  Charlie introduces himself as a family man who has lost his family.
With Charlie's resourcefulness and skill, the survivors slowly increase their quality of life, though Evie remains bitter about John's previous suicide attempt.  When she accuses him of being self-obsessed, Charlie tells her that he can provide for her better than John.  Evie becomes uncomfortable, but Charlie pushes for a relationship.  John suffers a serious asthma attack, and Evie begs Charlie to find medicine.  Charlie insinuates that he knows where to find it, but he will only retrieve it if Evie submits to sex.  Desperate, she does.  As John and Charlie later talk, Evie searches through Charlie's belongings and finds evidence that he lied about having a family.  John initially dismisses her concerns and says that they need Charlie to survive.
They run him off when Charlie reveals that he keeps a former lover, who has since become infected, chained in his car to observe.  Charlie immediately returns and angrily confronts them; he accuses them of being ungrateful and says that survival is only rule in this new society.  Since they can not survive without his help, he asserts that he should have whatever he wants.  John surrenders his pistol to Charlie and watches helplessly as Charlie drags Evie into their shelter to rape her.  John is anguished by Evie's cries for help but does nothing to assist her.  When a lost soldier suddenly shows up, John disarms him and learns about an extraction point.  John kills the soldier and shoots Charlie.  As he dies, Charlie shoots Evie in the arm.  John bandages her, but she struggles to stay conscious.
Charlie's car breaks down near the extraction point.  Drawn by John's yelling to alert the military forces he assumes must be near, zombies begin to converge on their location.  John pushes for them to continue on foot, but Evie is unable.  After urging her to stand several times, John eventually gives up and hands her a pistol.  When she realizes that he intends to leave her to die, Evie shoots John in the leg and uses him as a distraction while she escapes from the approaching zombies.  Evie proceeds on her own to the extraction point as John is devoured by the zombies.

The directors met each other at film school, where they became friends.  Evie represents the belief that there is an innate good in humanity, while Charlie represents a more self-serving amorality.
''Plague'' had a private screening at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne on 29 October 2014 and had its world premiere on 22 November 2014 at the Fantastic Planet Horror, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy Film Festival in Sydney.  Screen Media Films bought US distribution rights after the film played at the Marché du Film at Cannes, and they released it on demand in May 2015 and on DVD in June 2015.
John Noonan of ''Filmink'' wrote, "As a debut feature, it's a competently put together piece of work that offers up healthy slabs of scares, but it's often in danger of mistaking heightened emotions for character development."

'''''Infini''''' is a 2015 Australian science fiction film directed by Shane Abbess, and starring Daniel MacPherson, Grace Huang, and Luke Hemsworth.
In the early 23rd century, an emergency is declared on a mining station ''O.I. Infini'', and a search and rescue (SAR) team is sent in using Slipstream, a form of teleportation that allows near instantaneous travel. The location of ''O.I. Infini'' is proximal to a number of black holes meaning the mission operatives will experience severe time dilation. A team sent returns 30 seconds later in a berserk rage. Whit Carmichael, a new member of West Coast SAR, on his first day, teleports to ''Infini'' using an illegal teleporter after West Coast HQ activates a lethal lock down to contain the crisis. Before leaving for work that day, his wife tells him to do whatever it takes to return safely.
Less than a relative hour later, East Coast SAR is informed about the outbreak and the destruction of the West Coast SAR. They are informed a payload of something from the station has been programed by a deranged survivor, to teleport soon to Earth, which will destroy the planet. The SAR is ordered to halt the payload, and recover the one surviving member of the West Coast SAR, Whit. Arriving, they find a frozen slaughterhouse, eventually reuniting with Whit, who has had a week to figure out how the station operates. Whit explains that the mining staff slaughtered each other, tearing off their skin and killing one another. Whit is able to shut down the payload, but then the deranged survivor suddenly attacks, and when he is shot, everyone is sprayed with the survivor's blood. They begin to become enraged and violent. Whit hides from the others, then searches the station for remaining SAR personnel and anything he can learn about the infection. Finding a lab, he discovers a medical log. Discovering the planet is entirely composed of alien organic material, and when thawed forms a so-called "primordial ooze". It is capable of infecting, eventually mimicking and finally dominating, any biological tissue. He further discovers the ooze is aggressive, predatory in nature, and driven by self-preservation.
Suffering mentally from infection, Whit attempts to solicit help from the remaining members of the team, but they are suffering through advanced stages of the infection, which he is resisting better. They either attack each other, kill themselves, or attack Whit. This leaves Whit the last surviving human on the station. He records a message to the ooze which plays on a loop over the loudspeakers, criticizing it for harnessing only the violent instincts of humanity, instead of working with humans. He tells it that it failed. He then commits suicide. The ooze moves onto the bodies, and they awaken unharmed and no longer crazed, but clearly disturbed by what has happened. They agree to teleport back, and keep their story simple.  As they begin to teleportation, Whit sees several humanoid forms made of ooze, silently watching them go, one of them holding the picture of Whit's wife he carried with him.
Returning to Earth, the team is scanned, and asked if they are free from biological contaminants. They answer in the affirmative, and the scan successfully identifies them all.  Whit returns home to his wife, who had been told he was not coming back.

'''''Dead Men Don't Die''''' is a 1991 American horror-comedy film written and directed  by Malcolm Marmorstein and starring Elliott Gould and Melissa Sue Anderson.
News anchor Barry Baron (Elliott Gould) discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles (Melissa Sue Anderson) finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka (Mabel King), who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment.
In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose (Mark Moses). Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan (Phil Bruns) sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies.
On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh (Jack Betts), who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

'''''Burying the Ex''''' is a 2014 American comedy horror film directed by Joe Dante and written by Alan Trezza. The film stars Anton Yelchin, Ashley Greene, Alexandra Daddario and Oliver Cooper. It screened out of competition at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The film was released on June 19, 2015, by Image Entertainment.
Nice guy and horror fanatic Max (Anton Yelchin) is dating the beautiful-but-manipulative Evelyn (Ashley Greene). Evelyn is an extreme environmentalist working for a blog company that promotes "going green", while Max works a dead-end job at the local horror shop named Bloody Mary's. In many situations, Max often finds himself trapped trying to do whatever he can to keep Evelyn happy, including changing his diet and selling his old car. In addition to this, Max dreams of opening up a horror memorabilia shop of his own in the future, much to Evelyn's dismay. One day at the shop, Max unloads the latest shipments and finds a Satan Genie, an object that claims it can grant anyone's wants or desires. Believing it to just be another silly item for the shop, Max places it on the shelf in the storage room and dismisses it. Later that night, he and Evelyn have sex in the shop and make a promise to each other that they'll be together forever. Shortly thereafter, Max has Evelyn move in with him. Max and Evelyn initially decide to celebrate this new development in their relationship by grabbing a bite to eat. Wanting Evelyn to try something ''he'' enjoys for a change, Max suggests they go to I-Scream, a malt hot-spot run by Olivia (Alexandra Daddario). Evelyn is immediately unkind to Olivia and believes her and Max were flirting with each other. As Max pleads his case to her, Evelyn tearfully admits that she doesn't want to lose him and that he's the only thing in her life that has made her happy since her mother's death.
All seems to be great until Max comes back home to discover that Evelyn has redecorated their entire apartment to what she feels is aesthetically pleasing and has put away all of Max's collectables and posters, ruining their price values. This leads to an argument where Max states that he and Evelyn should be making decisions together instead of her taking the reins on every little thing all the time. Feeling that Evelyn's overbearing nature will lead him to be unhappy for the duration of their relationship, Max plans to break up with her but is too scared to do so. Max turns to his slacker half-brother Travis (Oliver Cooper) for advice. Travis suggests that Max break up with Evelyn in a public place so he can make a quick getaway and have everyone present see her for the control freak she truly is. However, the plan backfires when Evelyn accidentally gets hit by a bus on her way to the park. She dies in the middle of the road as a tearful Max watches.
A couple weeks go by and Max has shut himself off emotionally, feeling responsible for Evelyn's death. Travis swings by his place and, after seeing the funk he's in, encourages him to get back out and move on. Max eventually runs into Olivia again and starts to hit it off with her. As the night progresses, Max and Olivia learn that they both share the same fascination for horror. But when Max and Olivia visit the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Evelyn is shown to have risen up from the dead and has dug herself up out of the ground. After Olivia walks Max back home, he's quickly greeted by an undead Evelyn at the door. Evelyn is overjoyed and believes hers and Max's love is being given a second chance and thinks they're still dating. Frightened, Max realizes that the Satan Genie from the shop made their wish of being "together forever" come true and has brought Evelyn back from the dead. Still wanting to pursue Olivia, Max actively attempts to hide Evelyn from her. He's also left to ponder how exactly he's going officially dump Evelyn. Max presumes that the answer to his problems lie with the Satan Genie, only to have it shatter on the ground when he loses his footing. For his backup plan, Max then researches the occult/spell books the shop has available in the hopes of finding something that will send Evelyn back to her grave. He tries these techniques, but to no avail; as they have no effect on Evelyn whatsoever.
Travis stumbles upon Max with a drunken Evelyn, and is reluctant to help him. He soon has a change of heart and tells Max that the only true way he can get rid of Evelyn is to decapitate her with a machete. Max tries to accomplish this but backs out at the last minute. The day before Halloween, Olivia drops by the shop to visit Max. It's later interrupted by a phone call from Evelyn. Olivia (who still doesn't know that Evelyn's a zombie) thinks Max still hasn't gotten over her just yet, but offers him an invitation to a screening of ''Night of the Living Dead'' at the cemetery. Travis steps up to the plate and offers to kill Evelyn so Max can meet Olivia at the movie. Travis shows up at the apartment under the guise of searching for an old DVD Max never returned to him and intentionally prolongs his stay, annoying Evelyn. She then develops a sudden craving for brains and ends up eating Travis. Meanwhile, Max and Olivia are enjoying each other's company and end up having sex in the back of Olivia's car.
Upon Max's return, he discovers Travis's corpse in the living room. Knowing that Evelyn is now determined to kill anyone who gets in her way, Max tricks her into drawing a hot bubble bath for themselves in order to barricade the bathroom door and trap her inside. He rushes out of the apartment to get the police but leaves his cell phone behind. Evelyn doesn't take too long to break free and escapes. She then kidnaps Olivia after she's read the texts between her and Max. Having had no luck with the police, Max hears through one of the police scanners about someone knocking over a malt shop and realizes Olivia's in trouble. Back at the apartment, Max sees Olivia tied up and Evelyn threatens to kill her. A battle ensues between Max, Evelyn, and Olivia, ending with Travis (now revealed to be a zombie himself) fatally stabbing Evelyn through the chest with the machete. With Evelyn finally gone, Max and Olivia take her body back to the cemetery and bury her.
One year later, Max and Olivia's relationship is still going strong. Max has long since quit his job at Bloody Mary's, became business partners with Olivia-having joined his horror memorabilia store and her malt shop as an enterprise of their own-and is now truly happy. Max then surprises Olivia with an engagement ring, which she gladly accepts. And Travis, still in his zombie form, is shown sign-spinning outside the shop.

''Burying the Ex'' was originally produced as a 15-minute short in 2008, written and directed by Trezza. It starred Danielle Harris as Olivia and Mircea Monroe as Evelyn, with the male lead (then named Zak) played by John Francis Daley. Trezza later expanded the short into a feature film script. According to an interview with director Joe Dante in 2014:
I met Alan several years ago, got the script for the feature, which was not substantially different from the one we shot. I thought it was funny and different. Cut forward five years. Unexpectedly, after another project fell through, money appeared so we could make the movie, but we had to shoot cheaply and quickly. We shot in 20 days and it was a lot of fun, a hectic shoot, but there was a lot to do. We were clever about our locations and shooting all within the same area of town... The four leads are really fun and creative and brought a lot to the table.
Principal photography began November 17, 2013 and ended December 19, 2013.
Mary Woronov played the owner of a store called Bloody Mary's. However she was cut out of the film.
Dante said the film was "very EC Comics, but it's not a comic book movie, I think the characters are a little bit more real...  I was left alone in terms of creativity." He added that the film was made for his fans.
In January 2015, Image Entertainment acquired the release rights of the film,
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 28%, based on 24 reviews, with a rating of 4.3/10.

'''''Aswang''''' is a 2011 Filipino action horror thriller film based on the Filipino mythical creature that    is a shapeshifting monster usually possessing a combination of the traits of either a vampire, a ghoul, a witch, or different species.
The film is directed and co-written by Jerrold Tarog. It stars Lovi Poe, Paulo Avelino, Albie Casiño, Jillian Ward, Marc Abaya and Niña Jose. The movie is a remake of Peque Gallaga's 1992 film of the same name.
The film features a type of aswang called "Abwak". It  can transform from human to a raven-like creature that could fly and move underground as it stalks its victim. The film received generally positive reviews from critics praising its cinematography and narrative.
The numbers of the Abuwak race (Aswang) has declined and the only way they can survive is through the rare ability that only the soon-to-be queen of the Abuwaks, Hasmin (Lovi Poe), possesses. Abuwaks look human in their normal state, but they can fly when they transform into raven-like birds. They can also burrow through earth.They are quick and strong, and they can attack and eat humans whether in complete darkness or broad daylight. Hasmin doesn't like all of this, preferring to congregate with humans and even protecting them when her fellow creatures attack the village.
A hired killer named Daniel (Paulo Avelino) was forced into his disreputable trade as a youth. Like Hasmin, he doesn't like killing the innocent, and this reluctance leads him to the abuwak lair, suggested to be somewhere in Pampanga..Along with two other killers, they travel to the village in pursuit of the two remaining members of a lawyer's family that they massacred in Quezon City.

''Ria Limjap'' from Spot.ph gave a positive review saying that "This intelligent movie will compel the audience to think along with it-just as much as it will entertain, fascinate, and provide much needed escape."
''Phillip Cu-Unjieng'' from Philippine Star describe the film as "..heady, atmospheric foray into the folklore of aswangs and creatures that go bump in the night... and "road bump" in the fields."

'''''Dawn of the Dead''''' (also known internationally as '''''Zombi''''') is a 1978 American independent zombie horror film directed by George A. Romero.
It was written by Romero in collaboration with the Italian filmmaker Dario Argento, and produced by Claudio Argento, Richard P. Rubinstein and Alfredo Cuomo. It was the second film made in Romero's Night of the Living Dead (film series)|''Living Dead'' series, but contains no characters or settings from ''Night of the Living Dead'', and shows in a larger scale the apocalyptic effects on society. In the film, a phenomenon of unidentified origin has caused the reanimation of the dead, who prey on human flesh, which subsequently causes mass hysteria. The cast features David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross as survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall.
''Dawn of the Dead'' was filmed over approximately four months, from late 1977 to early 1978, in the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh and Monroeville, Pennsylvania|Monroeville.
In addition to four official sequels, the film has spawned numerous parodies and pop culture references. A remake of the movie premiered in the United States on March 19, 2004. It was labeled a "Remake|re-imagining" of the original film's concept.'', "re-imagining" is mentioned an interview with the writer of Dawn of the Dead (2004)'' In 2008, ''Dawn of the Dead'' was chosen by ''Empire'' magazine as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'',
The United States is devastated by a mysterious phenomenon which reanimates recently deceased human beings as flesh-eating zombies. Despite the best efforts by the U.S. government and local authorities to control the situation, millions of people are killed and reanimate; social order is collapsing. Some rural communities and the military have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, but urban centers are helpless and largely overrun. Confusion reigns at the WGON television studio in Philadelphia by the phenomenon's third week, where staff members Stephen Andrews and Francine Parker are planning to steal the station's traffic helicopter to escape the city. Meanwhile, police SWAT officer Roger DiMarco and his team raid a housing project where the residents are defying the martial law of delivering their dead to National Guardsmen. Some residents fight back with handguns and rifles, and are killed by both the overzealous SWAT team and their own reanimated dead. During the raid, Roger meets Peter Washington, part of another SWAT team, and they partner up together. Roger tells Peter that his friend Stephen intends to steal his workplace's helicopter and flee, and suggests that Peter come with them. They are informed of a group of zombies trapped in the basement, which they assist in the grim job of destroying.
That night, Roger and Peter rendezvous with Francine and Stephen and leave Philadelphia in the helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a shopping mall, which they decide to make their sanctuary. Francine reveals that she is pregnant. Peter offers to abort the child, but this is rejected. To make the mall safe for habitation, they block the entrances with trucks to keep the undead masses outside from building up enough cumulative force to break through; they also craft a wooden "false wall" to hide the access to their living space. During the blockade operation, Roger becomes reckless and is bitten by the zombies. After clearing the interior of zombies, the four are able to enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods in every store available to them. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds, soon reanimates and is shot in the head by Peter. After several months, all emergency broadcast transmissions cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed and a large portion of the population has been killed and reanimated. Francine, now visibly showing her pregnancy, looks around the group's now-lavishly appointed living space, barely enjoyed, and asks, "What have we done to ourselves?" Thereafter, Francine presses to be prepared to leave the shopping mall. Ammo and other stores are loaded into the helicopter, and Stephen teaches Francine how to operate the helicopter in case of emergency.
A gang of nomadic motorcyclists, having seen the helicopter during one of Francine's flying lessons, break into and start looting the mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies inside. While Peter suggests they let the bikers take what they want and move on, Stephen foolishly starts a gun battle with the bikers and is shot in the arm. He tries to escape through an elevator shaft, but is cornered by the undead and bitten several times. As some of the bikers, shot by Peter, are consumed by the zombies, the rest retreat with their stolen goods. A reanimated Stephen, apparently acting on a remnant of his former memories, breaks through the false wall and leads the undead to Francine and Peter. As Stephen enters their hideout, Peter kills him while Francine escapes to the roof. Peter then locks himself in a room and contemplates suicide. When zombies burst into the room, he has a change of heart and fights his way up to the roof, where he joins Francine. The two then fly away in the partially fueled helicopter to an uncertain future.

The history of ''Dawn of the Dead'' began in 1974, when George A. Romero was invited by friend Mark Mason of Oxford Development Company-whom Romero knew from an acquaintance at his alma mater, Carnegie Mellon-to visit the Monroeville Mall, which Mason's company managed. After showing Romero hidden parts of the mall, during which Romero noted the bliss of the consumers, Mason jokingly suggested that someone would be able to survive in the mall should an emergency ever occur. With this inspiration, Romero began to write the screenplay for the film.
Romero and his producer, Richard P. Rubinstein, were unable to procure any domestic investors for the new project. By chance, word of the sequel reached Italian horror director Dario Argento. A fan of ''Night of the Living Dead'' and an early critical proponent of the film, Argento was eager to help the horror classic receive a sequel. He met Romero and Rubinstein, helping to secure financing in exchange for international distribution rights. Argento invited Romero to Rome so he would have a change of scenery while writing the screenplay. The two could also then discuss plot developments. Romero was able to secure the availability of Monroeville Mall as well as additional financing through his connections with the mall's owners at Oxford Development. Once the casting was completed, principal shooting was scheduled to begin in Pennsylvania on November 13, 1977.
Principal photography for ''Dawn of the Living Dead'' (its working title at the time) began on November 13, 1977 at Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. Use of an actual, open shopping mall during the Christmas shopping season caused numerous time constraints. Filming began nightly once the mall closed, starting at 11 PM and ending at 7 AM, when automated music came on. As December arrived, the production decided against having the crew remove and replace the Christmas decorations-a task that had proved to be too time consuming. Filming was shut down during the last three weeks of the year to avoid the possible continuity difficulties and lost shooting time. Production would resume on January 3, 1978. During the break in filming, Romero took the opportunity to begin editing his existing footage.'''' on Ain't it Cool News
The airfield scenes were filmed at the Harold W. Brown Memorial Airfield in Monroeville,'''' at Turner Classic Movies an airport located about two miles from the mall that is still in use., Pennsylvania Department of Transportation The scenes of the group's hideout at the top of the mall were filmed on a set built at Romero's then-production company, The Latent Image. at Dark Destinations The elevator shaft was located there as well, as no such area of the mall actually existed. The gun store was also not located in the mall-for filming, the crew used Firearms Unlimited, a shop that existed in the East Liberty district of Pittsburgh at the time.
Principal photography on ''Dawn of the Dead'' ended in February 1978, and Romero's process of editing would begin. By using numerous angles during the filming, Romero allowed himself an array of possibilities during editing-choosing from these many shots to reassemble into a sequence that could dictate any number of responses from the viewer simply by changing an angle or deleting or extending portions of scenes. This amount of superfluous footage is evidenced by the numerous international cuts, which in some cases affects the regional version's tone and flow.

According to the original screenplay, Peter and Francine were to kill themselves, Peter by shooting himself and Fran by sticking her head into the path of the rotating main helicopter blades. The ending credits would run over a shot of the helicopter blades turning until the engine winds down, implying that the two would not have gotten far if they had chosen to escape.'''' at Horrorlair.com During production it was decided to change the ending of the film.
Much of the lead-in to the two suicides remains in the film, as Francine leans out of the helicopter upon seeing the zombies approach and Peter puts a gun to his head, ready to shoot himself. An additional scene, showing a zombie having the top of its head cut off by the helicopter blades (thus foreshadowing Francine's suicide) was included early in the film. Romero has stated that the original ending was scrapped before being shot, although behind the scenes photos show the original version was at least tested. The head appliance made for Fran's suicide was instead used in the opening SWAT raid, made-up to resemble an African-American male and blown apart by a shotgun blast.'''' at Horrorexpress.com

  Tom Savini, who had been offered the chance to provide special effects and make-up for Romero's first zombie film, ''Night of the Living Dead,'' before being drafted into the Vietnam War, made his debut as an effects artist on ''Dawn of the Dead''.'''' Slasherama.com Savini had been known for his make-up in horror for some time, prior to ''Dawn of the Dead'', and in his book explaining special effects techniques, ''Bizarro'', explains how his time in Vietnam influenced his craft. He had a crew of eight to assist in applying gray makeup to two to three hundred extras each weekend during the shoot. One of his assistants during production was Joseph Pilato, who played a police captain in the film and would go on to play the lead villain in the film's sequel, ''Day of the Dead''.
The makeup for the multitudes of extras in the film was a basic blue or gray tinge to the face of each extra. Some featured zombies, who would be seen close-up or on-screen longer than others, had more time spent on their look. Many of the featured zombies became part of the fanfare, with nicknames based upon their look or activity-such as Machete Zombie,'''' GamingReport.com  Sweater Zombie, and Nurse Zombie. "Sweater zombie" Clayton Hill, was described by a crew member as "one of the most convincing zombies of the bunch" citing his skill at maintaining his stiff pose and rolling his eyes back into his head, including heading down the wrong way in an escalator while in character.Balingit, Moriah. , ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', July 27, 2009. Retrieved July 30, 2009.
A cast of Ross' head that was to be used in the original ending of the film (involving a suicide rather than the escape scene finally used) ended up as an exploding head during the tenement building scene. The head, filled with food scraps, was shot with an actual shotgun to get the head to explode. One of the unintentional standout effects was the bright, fluorescent color of the fake blood that was used in the film. Savini was an early opponent of the blood, produced by 3M, but Romero thought it added to the film, claiming it emphasised the comic book feel of the movie.'''' DVDTalk review

The film's music varies with Romero's and Argento's cuts. For Romero's theatrical version, musical cues and selections were chosen from the De Wolfe Music Library, a compilation of stock music scores and cues. In the montage scene featuring the hunters and National Guard, the song played in the background is "'Cause I'm a Man" by the Pretty Things; the song was first released on the group's LP ''Electric Banana''. at Movie Grooves'' The music heard playing in a sequence in the mall and over the film's end credits is an instrumental titled "The Gonk"-a polka style tune from the De Wolfe Music Library, with a chorus of zombie moans added by Romero.'' track listing''
For Argento's international cut, the Italian director used the band Goblin (incorrectly credited as "The Goblins") extensively. Goblin is a four-piece Italian band that mostly provides contract work for film soundtracks. Argento, who received a credit for original music alongside Goblin, collaborated with the group to get music for his cut of the film. Romero used three of their pieces in his theatrical release version. The Goblin score would later find its way onto a ''Dawn of the Dead''-inspired film, ''Hell of the Living Dead''. The version of ''Dawn'' released on video in the mid-nineties under the label "Director's Cut" does not use most of the Goblin tracks, as they had not been completed at the time of that edit.
''Dawn of the Dead'' has received a number of re-cuts and re-edits, due mostly to Argento's rights to edit the film for international foreign language release. Romero controlled the final cut of the film for English-language territories. In addition, the film was edited further by censors or distributors in certain countries. Romero, acting as the editor for his film, completed a hasty 139-minute version of the film (now known as the Extended, or Director's Cut) for premiere at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. This was later pared down to 127 minutes for the U.S. theatrical release. The US theatrical cut of the film earned the taboo rating of X because of its graphic violence. Rejecting this rating, Romero and the producers chose to release the film unrated to help the film's commercial success., a documentary on the film's production. United Film Distribution Company eventually agreed to release it domestically in the United States. The film was refused classification in Australia twice: in its theatrical release in 1978 and once again in 1979. The cuts presented to the Australian Classification Board were Argento's cut and Romero's cut, respectively. ''Dawn of the Dead'' was finally passed in the country with an R18+ rating in February 1980.''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978) censorship history in Australia at  It was banned in Queensland until at least 1986.
Internationally, Argento controlled the Euro cut for non-English speaking countries. The version he created clocked in at 119 minutes. It included changes such as more music from Goblin than the three cuts completed by Romero, removal of some expository scenes, and a faster cutting pace.'''' review by Michael Elliott It actually debuted nearly nine months before the US theatrical cut.
Despite the various alternate versions of the film available, ''Dawn of the Dead'' was successful internationally. Its success in then-West Germany earned it the Golden Screen Award, given to films that have at least three million admissions within 18 months of release. A majority of these versions were released on DVD in the 2004 Special Edition, and have previously been released on VHS.

''Dawn of the Dead''-unlike many other "gory" horror staples of its time-has received acclaim from film reviews since its initial release. The film was regarded by many as one of the best films of 1978, Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave it four out of four stars and proclaimed it "one of the best horror films ever made." While conceding ''Dawn of the Dead'' to be "gruesome, sickening, disgusting, violent, brutal and appalling," Ebert said that "nobody ever said art had to be in good taste."'', a review by Roger Ebert'' Steve Biodrowski of ''Cinefantastique'' praised the film, calling it a "broader" version of ''Night of the Living Dead'', and gave particular credit to the acting and themes explored: "the acting performances are uniformly strong; and the script develops its themes more explicitly, with obvious satirical jabs at modern consumer society, as epitomized by the indoor shopping mall where a small band of human survivors take shelter from the zombie plague sweeping the country." He went on to say that ''Dawn of the Dead'' was a "savage (if tongue-in-cheek) attack on the foibles of modern society", showcasing explicit gore and horror and turning them into "a form of art".
''Dawn of the Dead'' was not without its detractors. Similar to the preceding ''Night of the Living Dead'', some critical reviewers did not like the gory special effects. Particularly displeased at the large amount of gore and graphic violence was ''The New York Times'' critic Janet Maslin, who claimed she walked out after the first 15 minutes due to "a pet peeve about flesh-eating zombies who never stop snacking," Leslie Halliwell of Halliwell's Film Guide stated the film was "occasionally laughable, otherwise sickening or boring."
The film was selected as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''Empire'' magazine in 2008. It was also named as one of ''The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made'', a list published by ''The New York Times''.
In 2004, after numerous VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases of several different versions of the film from various companies, Anchor Bay Entertainment released a definitive ''Ultimate Edition'' DVD box set of ''Dawn of the Dead'', following a single-disc U.S. theatrical cut released earlier in the year. The set features all three widely available versions of the film, along with different commentary tracks for each version, documentaries and extras., Anchor Bay Entertainment.com Also re-released with the DVD set was Roy Frumkes' ''Document of the Dead'', which chronicled the making of ''Dawn of the Dead'' and Romero's career to that point. The ''Ultimate Edition'' earned a Saturn Award for Best Classic Film Release.

'''''Quarantine L.A.''''', also known as '''''Infected''''', is a 2013 American action horror film about seven strangers who band together for survival in the aftermath of a devastating viral outbreak. The film was written and directed by Filip Maciejewicz, in his directorial debut, and starred Bo Linton, Eugenia Kuzmina and Adrian Voo.
A group of seven strangers survive and escape from an isolated area of Los Angeles that has been infected by a strange, human changing virus.
July 18, 2017 - An unknown type of virus starts to spread all over the Los Angeles area. In the first 14 days, it kills more than 3/4 of the population causing a major panic outbreak all around the world. The U.S. government isolates the entire affected zone. By the middle of September, the structure of the virus strain begins to evolve into a human changing virus. The infected become rotting, corpse-like creatures with an unconditional hunger for human flesh. During the day, they hide from the sun. By night, they begin to hunt like animals. All efforts to search for survivors in the area were deemed futile.
On November 26, a local news channel receives an exclusive video message from J.S.O.C. (Joint Special Operations Command) Chief Sergeant, Jake Miller. The video exposes that he and a group of six survivors are trapped in the infected zone and surviving on limited supplies and resources. The video was not well received by the J.S.O.C. special opts team who had previously announced that there were no survivors from the infected zone.

'''''Demons''''' ( The screenplay was written by Bava, Argento, Franco Ferrini and Dardano Sacchetti, from a story by Sacchetti. Filming took place in Berlin and Rome.
The film was followed up by seven sequels (most of which are in-name only), beginning with ''Demons 2'' in 1986.
On the Berlin subway, university student Cheryl gets off at her stop in the deserted subway station and is pursued by a mysterious, masked man. Rather than attacking her, the man offers her tickets to a free screening at the Metropol, an isolated and recently renovated local cinema. Cheryl talks her friend Kathy into going with her and they skip class to go see the film. At the crowded theater, they meet two preppy college boys, George and Ken, who take an immediate liking to the girls and help them get a can of cola out of the vending machine. The four sit together in the theater.
There are many people from all walks of life in the audience; a blind man and his guide daughter, an elderly married couple, a boyfriend and girlfriend, and a pimp named Tony along with his two prostitutes who look at the theater's display props in the foyer. One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film. The film being shown is a violent, disturbing horror film which features a look-alike of the mask from the lobby; it is about four teenagers who discover an old tomb and dig up the grave of a sixteenth-century fortune teller called Nostradamus. When the teenagers dig up Nostradamus's coffin, they find no body and instead an old book and a mask identical to the strange mask in the foyer. When one of the movie's characters puts the mask and is scratched by it just like Rosemary was by its doppelganger, he then turns evil and slaughters his friends with a kitchen knife.
Rosemary feels ill and goes to the bathroom, where the scratch on her face bursts open and spews out pus; she then transforms into a bloodthirsty, red-eyed demon like the one in the film. Rosemary attacks her friend, Carmen, who then rips through the screen and transforms into a demon in front of the rest of the cinema-goers. The group of uninfected people race to any exit they can find, only to find that they have all been bricked up making escape impossible. Although they attempt to barricade themselves in the balcony, many are attacked and infected by the demons. One of the demons escapes into the city when four punks break into the building through a back entrance; the punks are soon transformed into demons as well.
In the cinema, only George and Cheryl remain uninfected. Using a display motorcycle and sword props from the foyer, they ride through the auditorium, slicing down many demons. George kills nearly all of them when suddenly, a helicopter crashes through the roof. George and Cheryl use an emergency grappling hook and winch to climb to the roof, where they are attacked by the mysterious man from the subway. They are able to kill him by impaling his head on an exposed bit of rebar. The two climb down to the street and discover that the demonic infection has spread throughout Berlin. They are then chased by a horde of demons before being picked up by a jeep of well-armed survivors (a father and his two children) and they make their escape. As they drive out of the city to safety, Cheryl transforms into a demon and is shot by one of the other passengers, having her body fall out of the jeep and onto the road. With George being the cinema's last survivor, he escapes with the family in the jeep into a distant unknown future.

Dario Argento had an important influence on ''Dèmoni''. In addition to co-writing the script, he also produced the film. Argento's daughter, Fiore, plays the character of Hannah. Michele Soavi, a devotee of Argento's work and his assistant director on several films, also served as an assistant director on ''Dèmoni'' and has two starring roles, as the man wearing the silver mask and as Jerry, one of the characters in the film playing at the Metropol. Nicoletta Elmi, who plays the usherette, appeared in Argento's 1975 classic giallo ''Deep Red'', and she also had a small role in the 1971 horror film ''Twitch of the Death Nerve'' (directed by Mario Bava, the father of ''Dèmoni'' director Lamberto Bava).
Most of the interior cinema scenes were shot in an actual closed down movie theatre. The building still exists but is now a bank. At the same time, the building used for the exterior shots of the movie theatre still exists; it's a club called "Goya", whose appearance in the film has brought it fame and now regularly hosts horror conventions today. Filming took place in Germany and Italy, and as a reference to these countries' cinema, posters for Werner Herzog's ''Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht'' and Argento's ''Four Flies on Grey Velvet'' can be seen hanging in the Metropol's lobby. The music chosen for the film features several Heavy metal classics, and there is also an AC/DC poster in one scene.
''Demons'' was released to screens on 4 October 1985 in Italy and didn't see a release in the United States until the following year by the film distributor, Ascot Films, (an American small independent company that only released three films, ''Dèmoni,'' Bava's ''A Blade in the Dark,'' and ''The Check Is in the Mail...'', and is no longer in existence today) which released the film unrated to theaters and drive-ins across the U.S. on 30 May 1986. Months later that year, ''Dèmoni'' was released on VHS by New World Home Video. In 1999, the film saw a DVD release along with ''Demons 2'' by Anchor Bay Entertainment, also re-released on VHS. Two years later, ''Dèmoni'' was released in a double pack limited edition called the ''Dario Argento Collection''. In 2007, ''Dèmoni'' was once again released by Anchor Bay in a new edition and fully widescreen transfer.
Arrow Video was the first to release the two films on Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray/DVD in the UK. Demons and Demons 2 were first released on the Blu-ray Steelbook Case on April 30, 2012. Then later on May 21, 2012, the two films were released separately on Blu-ray.
''Demons'' holds a 56% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on nine reviews.
The film was listed at number 53 on US TV channel Bravo's ''The 100 Scariest Movie Moments'' countdown.
The soundtrack was released on LP. It has 1980s rock and Heavy Metal themes, while the sequel was pop and new wave oriented. The soundtrack was live performed during the twenty year Anniversary at Shock Pop Comiccon in February 2015. The instrumental soundtrack was composed by Claudio Simonetti.

'''''Demons 2''''' (Italian: '''''Dèmoni 2''''') is a 1986 Italian horror film directed by Lamberto Bava and co-written and produced by Dario Argento. It is a sequel to Bava's 1985 film ''Demons'' and stars David Knight, Nancy Brilli, Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni|Coralina Cataldi Tassoni as well as Argento's youngest daughter, Asia Argento, in her debut film performance at age 10. The film was also known as ''Demons 2: The Nightmare Returns''.
The film opens as if the events of the first film took place in reality, but this is actually a Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film, that the various residents of a high-rise apartment building are watching. Its story follows several teens trespass into a city that was deserted as a result of the outbreak. Finding the lifeless corpse of a demon, one of the teens revives it accidentally by dripping blood from a scratch into its mouth. 
In reality, frustrated party girl Sally Day locks herself in her bedroom when her boyfriend doesn't attend her sixteenth birthday party. As her friends try to persuade her to return to the party, she watches part of the film on television. Suddenly, the demon notices her, climbs through the television and attacks her. Sally is transformed into a demon, then attacks her friends, turning all but two of them into vile, bloodthirsty monsters.
The creatures' bile begins to seep through the building, burning through the ceiling and into other apartments and shorting out the electrical system. In one apartment, a dog licks up the bile and transforms into a vicious beast that attacks and kills its owner. A young boy left alone by his parents manages to avoid Sally and her rampaging demon friends, but is ultimately poisoned by the bile and becomes a monster. The demon boy attacks Hannah, a pregnant woman waiting for her husband to come home. She manages to kill the demon boy, but a flying demon bursts out of his body to further terrorize her. Her husband, George, has been trapped in the elevator with another woman. They plan to escape through a service hatch, but a demon bursts through the elevator door and infects the woman. She in turn attacks George but he is able to kill her before making his way to his and Hannah's apartment in time to kill the flying demon with an umbrella.
Meanwhile, a group of bodybuilders led by gym instructor Hank have barricaded themselves in the underground car park, along with a group of tenants. Unable to break down the garage doors, they decide to stand their ground and try to defend themselves with makeshift weapons, such as Molotov cocktails and a few shotguns. The demons eventually make it down to the garage and force their way in. Although they heavily outnumber the demons, the uninfected are relatively easily defeated and are either turned into demons themselves or killed.
The infected start making their way back up the building. George causes a leak in the gas pipes and causes an explosion that kills all the infected except Sally. Hannah and George search for a way out and go into Sally's apartment, finding the original two partygoers that had hidden. The group make their way to the roof but are stopped by Sally. She infects the two partygoers but George manages to dispatch them. George and Hannah lower themselves to the roof of an adjacent building, fighting Sally as they go. Inside the neighboring building Hannah gives birth to the couple's child. George defeats the resilient Sally in mortal combat, and he and Hannah make their way outside with their newborn child.

'''''Maniac Cop 2''''' is a 1990 American action horror film directed by William Lustig and written by Larry Cohen. It is the second installment in the ''Maniac Cop'' series. it stars Robert Davi, Claudia Christian, Michael Lerner, and Bruce Campbell.  Robert Z'Dar returns as Matthew Cordell, an undead cop-turned-serial killer following his own murder.
After being impaled by a pipe and plunging into a river at the end of the previous film, the undead Maniac Cop Matthew Cordell acquires a junked police cruiser and continues his killing spree through New York City. Finding a convenience store in the middle of a robbery, he kills the clerk; the thief is subsequently killed in a shootout with police. As Cordell stalks the streets, his enemies Officers Jack Forrest and Theresa Mallory are put back on duty by Deputy Commissioner Edward Doyle, who has the two undergo a psychiatric evaluation under Officer Susan Riley. While Jack is content that Cordell is long gone and wants to go on with his life, Theresa is convinced that Cordell is still alive and plotting his revenge.
At a newsstand, Jack is stabbed through the neck by Cordell, which leaves Theresa distraught and prompts her to appear on a talk show to inform the public about Cordell, as the police have kept Cordell's supposed return covered up, as Commissioner Doyle was involved in originally framing Cordell and sending him to Sing Sing. While en route to a hotel in a taxi, Theresa is joined by Susan, and the two are attacked by Cordell, who kills the cabbie and forces Susan and Theresa off the road. After handcuffing Susan to the steering wheel of a car and sending her into the busy streets, Cordell kills Theresa by snapping her neck. Gaining control of the car, Susan crashes and is found and given medical attention.
Elsewhere, a stripper named Cheryl is attacked in her apartment by Steven Turkell, who has strangled at least six other exotic dancers. As Turkell brutalizes Cheryl, Cordell arrives, disposes of a pair of officers earlier called by Cheryl, and helps Turkell escape. Grateful for the help, Turkell befriends Cordell and takes him back to his apartment, where Cordell stays for a short while. After Cordell leaves, Turkell goes out to find another victim but is identified at a strip club by Cheryl. He is arrested and placed in a holding cell by Susan and Detective Lieutenant Sean McKinney.
Turkell taunts Susan, telling him Cordell will break him out. Turkell's assumption proves correct, as Cordell breaks into the police station and massacres the bulk of the police force in a hail of gunfire. Using Susan as a hostage, Turkell, Cordell, and another criminal named Joseph Blum hijack a prison bus and head to Sing Sing, where Turkell believes Cordell wants to free all the inmates and create an army of criminals. McKinney and Doyle follow, and McKinney convinces Doyle to reopen Cordell's case and rebury his casket with full honors on the assumption that this will appease Cordell.
Cordell bluffs his way into the prison using Blum's paperwork, and the others kill a guard for his keys. Shortly after entering death row, Cordell is contacted over the prison PA system by Doyle, who admits to Cordell that he was set up and states that his case has been reopened. After hearing Doyle's announcement, Cordell abandons Turkell, Blum, and Susan and heads deeper into the prison, where he is attacked with a Molotov cocktail by the three inmates who originally mutilated him. While burning, Cordell finally gets revenge on the three convicts who mutilated him and assaults the other prisoners (killing one of them, who didn't mutilate him, in the process), only to be attacked by Turkell, who realizes Cordell used him. As Cordell and Turkell fight, the two crash through a wall, fall onto the bus below, and seemingly die when the vehicle explodes.
Sometime later, Cordell is buried with full honors alongside other fallen officers; Susan and McKinney attend his funeral. As Cordell's casket is lowered, McKinney throws Cordell's badge into the grave, leaves with Susan, and delivers a monologue about how there is a little bit of Cordell in every officer, and that every member of the force needs to rise above becoming a Maniac Cop. Before the credits roll, Cordell's hand bursts through the lid of his casket and grabs his badge.

Blue Underground gave the film a limited theatrical release in the United States in October 2013, which was followed by the Blu-ray and DVD release on November 19, 2013.
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of 10 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.1/10.
Lustig considers ''Maniac Cop 2'' to be his best film, saying, "It was the film [where] I felt as though myself and my crew were really firing on all cylinders. And I think we made a terrific B-movie", and also thinks it's superior to the first ''Maniac Cop'' film.

'''''Curse of the Cannibal Confederates''''' (also known as '''''The Curse of the Screaming Dead''''') is a 1982 American horror film directed by Tony Malanowski and distributed by Troma Entertainment. The film follows six friends who unwittingly raise the undead corpses of Confederate soldiers.
A group of six friends (Mel, Wyatt, Bill, Blind Kiyomi, Lin, and Sarah) are on a deer hunt in the southern United States. Kiyomi hears noises in the distance, and her boyfriend Mel goes to investigate. He then leads the others to a church graveyard in the woods where long-dead Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War are buried. The group argues over whether to take the items that they find in the graves. Unbeknownst to the others, Mel takes a diary from one of the soldiers. They set up camp, and that night, they are attacked by the soldiers, who are now zombies. The group manages to fight the soldiers off with their guns. They leave the area and are stopped by police officers, who do not believe their story. Soon after, they are attacked by the soldiers again; Bill and the officers are killed and eaten. The others retreat to an abandoned house. The soldiers follow them there and kill Kiyomi, Sarah, and Mel. Wyatt gives the diary back, and the soldiers leave.

Filming took place in Maryland.
The film is a remake of sorts. It is based on a film that director Malanowski had collaborated with star Steve Sandkuhler, known as ''Night of Horror''. The former was also about dead Confederate soldiers tormenting a bunch of dirty hippies in a Winnebago.
Despite no critical reviews, the film has a 23% score from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes based on 125 user ratings, with an average of 2.1/10.
In his book, ''All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger'', Troma president Lloyd Kaufman lists this among the five worst films in Troma's library.
Mark Redfield, who played a minor role in the film, was one of the few crew members whose career continued after the film; he directed and starred in the critically successful 2006 film ''The Death of Poe''.  Coincidentally, in Redfield's first collaboration with Malanowski, ''Night of Horror,'' one of the characters constantly quotes Poe's poem, ''The Raven''.
''Curse of the Cannibal Confederates'' was featured in the Achievement Hunter show "Theater Mode" in August 2016.

On the road to the school, they encounter an uninfected woman begging for help. They hop out of the bus to help, but are ambushed by a group of uninfected desperate to get out of the city. Gunner shoots several of them as the others hop in the bus and take off. Gunner chases after the bus, barely getting on board before it pulls away.
After driving a ways, they come across a yellow school bus. Gunner realizes it was a bus from the facility. Gunner forces Wheeler to stop so he can inspect the school bus. Gunner finds his wife, who is dead. He asks Dr. Chase if the infected eat people. 
Finally arriving at the school the team is able to find supplies. Searching for the survivors, the team comes across a room barricaded from the inside. Once breaking through the doors, they see all of the survivors are dead. After a few seconds, some of the infected wake up and charge at the team. All, except Gunner, escape through a window. 
Wheeler separates himself from Dr. Chase and Denise, causing them to seek shelter elsewhere. They find shelter in an abandoned Oriental store, where Dr. Chase confesses she is really Rebecca Thomas who came to the facility to find her daughter Meghan. 
Both Denise and Rebecca are ambushed by a Level 5. After a long struggle, Wheeler impales the Level 5, killing it instantly. 
Wheeler claims he made contact with a Doctor from a previous excursion who has 8 survivors nearby, and they need to return to the facility. 
Rebecca realizes Wheeler has a bleeding wound on his side and is infected. She makes a deal; he hot wires the ambulance to save the survivors, takes Rebecca to her home to find her daughter, and she will return him to the facility to be treated as a Level 1.
Before arriving at the hospital, Denise is hit by a car and kidnapped by Level 3s. With her helmet cam still recording, the infected are shown cutting her open and eating her. 
Rebecca shoots and kills the infected. Wheeler consoles her and they continue searching for the hospital. 
Once they reach the survivors and hot wire the ambulance, the Doctor with the survivors knocks out Rebecca, yelling that she isn't Dr. Chase. The survivors escape, causing Wheeler and Rebecca to hot wire a different ambulance. 
Rebecca and Wheeler finally reach her house. She finds Meghan, tests her blood, and realizes Meghan is infected. While waiting in the ambulance, Wheeler is ambushed by Level 5s. Rebecca, realizing they need to run, has Meghan change into her suit from the facility. 
Wheeler escapes the ambulance and rushes into the house, causing Rebecca and Meghan to run upstairs. All three escape through a window, but Wheeler is bitten multiple times and can no longer walk. Rebecca is forced to leave him.
Rebecca and Meghan make it to the ambulance and rush to the facility. On the way to the facility, Rebecca sees the other ambulance on fire.
Finally arriving at the facility, the guards are able to kill multiple infected, but do not recognize Rebecca without her suit from the facility. She pleads with the guards to not shoot her daughter. Rebecca, in turn, is shot multiple times.
Meghan is taken into the facility for Level 1 treatment under the impression she is really Dr. Chase. 
Level 1: Similar to flu; sufferers run fevers and feel weak and tired.
Level 2: Hemorrhaging phase where people begin to bleed from their orifices.
Level 3: Patients begin to secrete black necrotic blood from too much internal blood loss. They have diminished mental capacity, confusion, and extreme aggression.
Level 4: Hibernation phase, originally thought to be an end phase.
Level 5:The final stage after hibernation. Severe brain damage has been sustained through the preceding phases, and patients become extremely violent, attacking and killing anything with which they come into contact.

Suits came upon the script, which was initially named ''Viral'', at the Blood List, a repository of unproduced horror and thriller scripts. Suits does not consider the film to be found footage and instead says, "Rather than a found footage movie, I consider it more as a POV first-person movie." The camera setups were designed to simulate this first-person POV rather than someone who is carrying a camera. Suits said that they did not have a successful formula to follow for such a film, though he watched ''Maniac'' and ''Enter the Void'' for inspiration. Two camera operators, one male and one female, shot the film. The camera operator of the appropriate sex would substitute for whichever character's POV was represented.
Although he was a gamer in his youth, Suits said he could not find time to play many video games for research. Instead, he talked to gamer friends, watched YouTube videos, and discussed interesting kill scenes with the stunt coordinator.
''Pandemic'' premiered at London FrightFest Film Festival#Glasgow|FrightFest Glasgow on February 26, 2016. It replaced ''Cell'' at the last moment.
Jonathan Hatfull of ''SciFiNow'' described it as "an energetic POV zombie action movie with some impressive action and less than impressive characterisation".

 The movie is part of a series of films based on novels written by Project Itoh. It was followed by ''Harmony'' and ''Genocidal Organ''. 
The film was released on October 2, and Egoist perform the film's ending theme. The film was originally set for release in December, but the date was later changed to October 2. The film is licensed in North America by Funimation who gave the film a limited theatrical release on April 19 & 20, 2016,
In an alternate version of 18th Century England scientist Victor Frankenstein discovered a method of reanimating a corpse with a soul that could think, feel and speak. After his creation was destroyed another method was used to replace the missing Soul with an artificial soul known as "Necroware." It can be upgraded like a computer programme, though the corpses are unable to speak, feel or think for themselves. 
By the 19th century, the use of corpses becomes more common as Necroware is improved daily via a machine known as Charles Babbage in which Corpse Engineers have access to. John Watson, an aspiring corpse engineer, illegally creates his own Necroware and resurrects his deceased friend who he renames Friday. M, a member of British Secret service, makes a deal with Watson after catching him: either he goes to prison or becomes an agent of the British Empire. Watson chooses the latter.
In India, Watson and Friday follow former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and his unnamed secretary. Watson and Friday are attacked by corpse assassins but are saved by Captain Frederick Burnaby, Watson's bodyguard. Watson is tasked by M to find Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov, a Russian corpse engineer who stole The Memorandum, which also happened to be Frankenstein's original research on reanimating a corpse with a soul. Watson is ordered to retrieve the research. Watson and Burnaby meet with Nikolai Krasotkin to act as their guide to Kabul where Karamazov is hiding.
They reach the Khyber Pass and are ambushed by upgraded corpses and rescued by Grant's secretary. Watson retrieves an advanced corpse who is able to speak its own name; Krasotkin suspects that Watson is planning to use the Memorandum to fully resurrect Friday. Watson is approached by the woman Hadaly Lilith, Grant's secretary, wishing to know if the advanced corpses contained souls, but Watson is unsure. 
They locate Karamazov who explains his wish to resurrect a human as Frankenstein once did. Karamazov upgrades Nikolai, whose soul is replaced by an artificial soul while Nikolai is still alive. This kills Nikolai but creates a more intelligent corpse capable of limited thought and speech. Watson is dismayed this was what Frankenstein's original creature was and angrily berates Karamazov for not trying to improve the technology. Karamazov admits the Memorandum is in Japan and asks Watson to destroy it. Karamazov then commits suicide by having Nikolai upgrade him. Watson, Friday and Burnaby depart to Japan, leaving Nikolai, Karamazov and his corpse servants to mindlessly follow their Necroware programming forever.
A year later in Tokyo, Watson meets Yamazawa Seigo of the Imperial Japanese Army, who knows the Memorandum is held by the Osato Chemical company. Watson, along with Friday, Burnaby, and Seigo infiltrate Osato Chemical, but are attacked by advanced corpses in armour. Watson flees to find the Memorandum and has Friday analyse it, setting off a trap that sets fire to the building. The analysis causes Friday to lash out and try to speak. A strange man retrieves the Memorandum, revealing himself as Frankenstein's original creation, known as The One - still alive after 100 years and just as intelligent as a human.
Watson awakes aboard the USS Richmond heading for America. Burnaby is also on board and the feral Friday is in chains. Grant wants Watson to work for him to defeat The One, who hates humans for creating him, but Watson spends the voyage fixing Friday. Upon reaching San Francisco, The One uses the Memorandum to send out a signal that causes corpses to attack humans, including the corpse crew of the USS Richmond. During the escape, Hadaly reveals she is an artificial life form created by her "father" Thomas Edison, and she can control corpses using sound waves and desires to one day have a soul of her own. She escapes with Watson, Friday, and Burnaby while Grant is killed by an exploding corpse. At Hadaly's safe house, Watson finishes fixing Friday, making him immune to the Memorandum's signal.
The One is captured by M, who plans to turn all humans into corpses; thus ending every war. The One is taken to the Tower of London where he has his mind analysed by Charles Babbage and the preserved brain of Victor Frankenstein. A new stronger signal is sent out by M causing even more corpses to attack humans. Aboard the submarine USS Nautilus, Watson, Hadaly, Friday and Burnaby smash through the Traitors' Gate. Burnaby fights the corpse guards with Hadaly's flamethrower while the others fight their way to M. Hadaly knocks out M and uses her sound waves to suppress The One's mind, while Friday takes over Charles Babbage to stop the signal. M awakens and shoots Hadaly before being shot by Watson. Now free, The One kills M, overpowers Hadaly, and takes over Friday.
The One finally reveals his true plan, to create the bride Victor Frankenstein promised him. Having orchestrated everything, he plans to combine all the corpses primitive minds into a true human mind. Then, using the Memorandum and Charles Babbage, he will create a human soul from the knowledge inside Victor Frankenstein's brain and insert both the true mind and the human soul into Hadaly while he transfers his own soul and mind into Friday's body. As The One is on the verge of success, Burnaby damages Charles Babbage. The One is returned to his own body and Friday restarts taking over Charles Babbage, sealing The One's soul inside the Memorandum. The One tries to drag Watson in with him. Inside the Memorandum, Watson struggles until a smiling Friday helps him and The One is defeated.
Watson awakes in time to escape the collapsing building with Hadaly and an unconscious Friday. Hadaly laments over having acquired and lost her soul, though Watson assures her he likes her just the way she is. She urges him not to give up trying to resurrect Friday.
Back in the house where he resurrected Friday, Watson is seen combining the research of Karamazov with the surviving pages of the Memorandum to perform an unknown corpse upgrade on himself. 
4 years later in London, Watson is seen fleeing with his new companion, Sherlock Holmes, whilst Burnaby and Hadaly, who now goes by the name Irene Adler, watch from nearby. What appears to be a fully resurrected Friday also watches from a rooftop.

 is a Japanese horror manga by Kengo Hanazawa.
A live action film adaptation directed by Shinsuke Sato and starring Yo Oizumi, Kasumi Arimura and Masami Nagasawa, premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 13, 2015, was released commercially on April 23, 2016.
-ku, Tokyo
The story begins with Hideo Suzuki, a 35-year-old manga artist assistant, whose life seems to be stuck around his exhausting but low-paying job, unfulfilled dreams, strange hallucinations and unsatisfying relationships. He sees himself as a supporting character in his own life, and has low self-esteem, resulting in frustration.
One day, the world as Hideo knows it is shattered by the presence of a disease that turns people into homicidal maniacs that look and have the characteristics of a zombie, whose first instinct is to attack and devour the nearest human. Armed with only his sporting shotgun, he runs for his life, meeting strangers along the way. For a while, he and his companions struggle to stay alive, while questioning their moral choices. In the end, only three of them remained and drove all the way to the top of Mt. Fuji to be saved.
* '''Hideo Suzuki''': A down-on-his-luck manga artist struggling to publish his own work while maintaining both a day job as another artist's assistant and a strained relationship with his girlfriend. Hideo is slightly paranoid and mentally disturbed, often having conversations with an imaginary figure named Yajima, hallucinating the presence of faces around him, and fantasizing about how conversations with his co-workers and girlfriend should proceed. Though he was bitten on the hand by his girlfriend, the bite did not break the skin and draw blood, narrowly avoiding infection. He seems to have gained the mysterious ability to manipulate the movements of the infected like a puppeteer. After Hiromi leaves, Hideo travels into the city and gets involved in a four-way standoff between himself, the Kurusu Cult, a group of survivors, and the giant creature that Hiromi joined with.
* '''Hayakari Hiromi''': A teenage girl who is empathetic towards the undead, shown to apparently be able to kill them by giving them closure with their life. Later, she is infected but still retains most of her personality. Post infection, she loses all the superficial symptoms of the infected (protruding black veins, bloodshot eyes). She eventually has sex with Hideo before allowing the infection to take her and joins the infected hivemind, allowing herself to be consumed by a massive building sized creature, whereupon her more base desires take control and she aids the creature in its attempt to murder Hideo, since he refuses to willingly join the infected. At the last second before devouring him, however, Hiromi's original self fights its way back to the surface and she convinces the creature to let Hideo live, under the pretense of allowing him to suffer more.
* '''Yabu Oda''': A former nurse who was reduced to the role of a sex slave for the group staying at the Gotemba Premium Outlets. She escapes with Hideo and Hiromi, and she understands the significance of Hiromi's condition in potentially understanding and curing the disease. She and Hideo have sex, whereupon she discovers that she is pregnant with the child of one of the men from the outlet. She was subsequently infected by an infant and forced Hiromi to kill her and the child by crushing them in a nearby garbage truck. However, it is revealed after Hiromi joins the infected that she was subconsciously glad that she was allowed to kill Oda, since she was jealous over her and Hideo having sex.
* '''Kurusu''': The main human antagonist. A young adult who gained superhuman strength, regeneration, and speed following his infection by his mother, whom he beat to death in an online video to display his powers and how to kill the infected. He rallies disenfranchised youths via a message board to "create a new world". He was assumed to have been killed in a three way fight with a fellow immune person known as the "Naked Emperor" and a member of his cult named Takeshi, who had gained powers similar to his own. He later appears to Hideo after Hideo is partially swallowed by a zombie. He reappears with his cult in Tokyo trying to overthrow a surviving group, having survived his fight with Takeshi and the Naked Emperor. Before he gained his powers, Kurusu had spent most of his life in a comatose state, unable to communicate yet fully aware of the world around him.
* '''Kurusu's cult''': Disenfranchised youths who communicate on message boards and worship Kurusu. They mostly stay at home until are recruited by Kurusu himself and survived the outbreak by virtue of being shut-ins.
* Other than the major characters, two characters have been used to display the ZQN epidemic in other parts of the world as they and the people around them fall to the infection. Kazu, Hideo's colleague, experiences the outbreak in Taipei and is infected together with his girlfriend. Jan, a Belgian, went back to Brussels to find his son, where he suddenly lost his memory inexplicably. After travelling around, seeing several zombies and a mutated one, he ends up in the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, and his fate is left unknown when the church is presumably destroyed by airstrikes as he begins to show signs of infection. Another sidestory follows an immune little girl in Italy who is trapped in a belltower with a group of zombies, only to be rescued by another immune man, who eats the flesh of the infected, and who takes it upon himself to protect and raise the little girl.
The manga is serialized in the Japanese manga magazine ''Big Comic Spirits'' published by Shogakukan starting in 2009. Shogakukan has compiled the chapters into 21 volumes so far starting from August 28, 2009. It is also published in Italy by GP Manga,
Junji Ito wrote a one-shot spinoff of the series titled "She Is A Slow Walker" for ''Big Comic Spirits'' in February 2016.
It was nominated for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Manga Taisho awards
As of November 30, 2015, the series had sold 4 million copies.http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/11/30-1/i-am-a-hero-live-action-film-set-for-release-on-april-23-2016

'''''Boo! A Madea Halloween''''' is a 2016 American comedy horror film directed, written, starring and co-produced by Tyler Perry. The idea for the film originated from a fictitious Madea Halloween movie that was mentioned in Chris Rock's 2014 film ''Top Five''. It is the eighth in the ''Madea'' series, and it is the second ''Madea'' film (the first being ''Madea's Witness Protection'') to not be adapted from a stage play. The film was released on October 21, 2016 by Lionsgate, received generally negative reviews and grossed $74 million.
The film begins with Jonathan and his fellow fraternity brothers discussing their upcoming Halloween party. Tiffany and her three friends Aday, Rain and Leah are walking past their frat house, as Jonathan and rest of them all come out to invite them to the party and seem to flirt a little. Brian catches them at the frat house, which he has ordered Tiffany not to walk by and orders her and her friends to get in the car, in which she refuses and tells him they can walk home, because it's right around the corner. Brian forbids her from going near the frat house and reveals that he is sending her and her brother to their mom's house while he is out of town, much to her dismay. Brian then spies on Tiffany's conversation with Jonathan, the frat president, on a tablet and notices how sexual things seem to be getting.
Meanwhile, Madea and Aunt Bam are sitting outside of her home giving away candy to kids trick-or-treating while Bam is secretly stealing the children's candy until one kid (dressed as a cow, which Madea mocks the kid's mother for) notices her stealing his and an argument ensues. After that a clown approaches with a huge jack-in-the-box, which frightens Bam. As the clown is approaching, Madea is threatening him and dares something to jump out of the box. Another clowns pops out and she's punches the clown, causing it to fall out of the box. It is revealed to be Joe and Hattie who explained they were just trying to scare them for fun. Meanwhile, in order to keep Tiffany from sneaking off to the Halloween party, Brian calls Madea, out of options, to stay there and look after Tiffany to keep her away from the party which Joe and Hattie tag along for after Brian promises to pay Madea. Tiffany and her friend Aday, realizing that Madea and the others are there to watch them, decide to trick them into sleeping early by faking a story about how a man named Mr. Wilson who committed murders in their house and the only safe rooms are the bedrooms and she then convinces them by secretly hitting a remote control to turn the lights off in the house.
Tiffany and Aday sneak off to the party but Madea sees through the scheme after finding pillows placed under the blankets to look as if they are sleeping. Madea searches for Tiffany, but Tiffany's friends and Jonathan both lie to cover for her. Madea shuts the party down but is thrown out by the frat brothers into the bushes, by Jonathan's orders and leaves defeated. However, one of the frat brothers discovers that Aday is underage and throws her out of the party which is then shut down again when Bam calls the police due to Tiffany being underage. The frat brothers realize that Madea and her friends are the ones behind it and decide to prank them back by scaring them, unaware that Aday has been hiding behind the outside staircase and overheard their entire plan.
Back at home, Tiffany still claims that she was asleep the whole time and had been sleeping in her father's room. The brothers begin their pranks by scaring Hattie, Joe and Bam by posing as the ghost of Mr. Wilson (which Jonathan had learned from Tiffany earlier) and by one of the frat boys, Horse (Brock O'hurn) appearing as a clown in the house. Madea, Hattie, Bam and Joe drive away out of fear and leave Joe alone with the clown which he knocks out with his cane while he is smoking pot.
Madea's car breaks down up the road and the three are pursued by the rest of the frat and partygoers who are posing as zombies that chase them down. Madea goes into the church led by Aday's parents and finds interest in being saved, believing that the things she is seeing are punishment for her sins. Aday's father and Aday reveal to Madea that all of the things happening were pranks being played on them by the frat brothers as revenge for shutting down the party. Aday, her father, Hattie, Joe, Bam and Madea decide to prank the brothers back.
Brian is also called back into town to deal with Tiffany for sneaking off. When Brian orders her to come downstairs she is first hesitate then finally comes down. When he asks and confronts her about sneaking off to the party, she boldly admits to it and tells him to get over It. It is clear Tiffany has zero respect for Brian as a parent due to him being a pushover and refusing to discipline his kids the same way he was raised by Joe. Madea, Hattie and Bam begin to pack Tiffany's clothes up in bags to throw her out of the house. This plan works and Tiffany and Brian lay their feelings out about Brian's wife cheating on him and him being a pushover. Brian, finally toughening up, participates in helping to throw her out and exclaims that she can either live there with him, abiding by his rules or go out on the street on her own. Tiffany apologizes to Brian and the women for her behavior and agrees to listen to her father's rules. Afterwards, the police return to Brian's house looking for Tiffany, revealing to her that her best friend, Aday has gone missing. They then take her with them and handcuff her.
The next day, the police knock on the door of the frat house and one of the brothers discovers the body of Aday with a throat slit full of blood in the basement. The brothers are arrested after the police find Aday's body and they are all placed on a prison bus. Rain and Leah are also arrested for bringing minors to an "over-18" party, as well as Tiffany for her alleged involvement. A brawl breaks out on the bus with the prisoners, scaring everyone including Jonathan. Aday comes out of the house and everything is revealed to be a prank. The girls are grateful that Aday is alive, and Jonathan apologizes for his and his frat brothers' behavior as well. Just then, Madea learns, much to her shock, that Brian called in actual police officers. They find a bag of marijuana in the frat house, and one of which recognizes Madea. Madea, Jonathan and the rest of the frat brothers flee from the officers as the film ends.

'''''Scarecrows''''' is a 1988 American horror film written and directed by William Wesley. The film centers around a group of mercenaries who have hijacked a plane. After one of their number escapes with the money, they land near a farmhouse surrounded by scarecrows. As the group searches the scarecrow-infested grounds and are picked off one by one by an unseen assailant, they come to realize that something evil lurks  on the grounds... 
''Scarecrows'' is about five bank robbing paramilitary mercenaries and war criminals who steal three million dollars from Camp Pendleton and take two hostages, a pilot and his daughter. As the robbers fly towards Southern waters, one of the robbers steals the loot and parachutes into a dark field. The remaining robbers land the plane and head for a broken-down house. The house has a demonic history, which causes scarecrows guarding surrounding graves to become animate and slaughter all trespassers, dooming their victims to live on as scarecrows for all eternity.

Filming took place in Davie, Florida.
Cinematography was by Peter Deming, who would go on to work on ''Hellraiser'' and ''Evil Dead 2''.
The film was released on VHS by Forum Home Video in 1988.  The company released the film in both R-rated and unrated versions. 
The film was released on DVD on September 11, 2007 by MGM/Fox.
Critical reception for the film has been mixed.
Allmovie gave the film a positive review stating, "Tightly paced and consistently tense, this low-budget film has slick production values (making it appear more expensive than it probably was) and only falters in some laughably overwrought performances".
Time Out gave the film a mostly positive stating in its review for the film, "Although a little slow to get started, this better-than-average horror movie makes excellent use of its creepily-lit monsters, is reasonably well put together, and features some stomach-turning grisliness".
Steve Barton from Dread Central awarded the film a score of 3.5 / 5 stating, "As fun as it is over-the-top violent, ''Scarecrows'' is the perfect fit for viewers looking to strap in for some good old fashioned mindless mayhem".
Ian Jane from DVD Talk gave the film a mixed review saying, "While the movie looks and sounds okay and is presented here in its uncut form, it hasn't aged all that well and the barebones presentation doesn't help anything. Scarecrows has got some solid gore and will definitely provide children of the 80s with a fun sense of nostalgia, but it's not a great film".

Nick Carter had been aspiring to make a movie for years. In the past he's made several independent short films and in 2014 he started an Indiegogo campaign to fund his first feature-length movie titled ''Evil Blessings''. Later that year however the director, Sxv'leithan Essex, died. This led Carter into scrapping the movie and replaced it with another movie, ''Dead 7'', initially titled ''Dead West''. In 2015, he landed the support of The Asylum, the production company behind Sharknado and many other SyFy productions, to produce the movie.
Filming began on August 20, 2015, in Anaconda, Montana at the 1880s ranch in the Valley just outside of town. They spend a week and a half filming at the ranch, and finally they went to Butte, Montana.http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/120711/first-images-from-dead-7-feature-the-backstreet-boys-in-the-wild-west/ Locations in Butte to film includes The Dumas Brothel & The World Mining Museum. The final location was the Lady of The Rockies looking over the city. That was the reason why producer Dylan Fox choose Montana, because one of his production assistants show him a photo of The Lady of The Rockies while they were searching the state for filming locations and he agreed. They even had to rewrite the ending of the script, just to add the Lady of The Rockies to it. About 250 locals from in & around the Anaconda & Butte areas were used as zombie extras, although 500 Montanans showed up for audition, including about half from Bozeman, Missoula & Helena. Production wrapped on September 8, 2015.

'''''JeruZalem''''' is a 2015 Israeli supernatural horror film.
In 1972, two priests are called to record an event at Jerusalem. It is revealed that Jewish, Muslim, and Christian priests were all called to perform an exorcism on a woman who supposedly died three days before. Her son claims she was calm at first, but became violent later, injuring her husband. After failed attempts to cure her, the priests decide they have no choice but to kill the woman. In a final attempt, the woman screams while sprouting leather wings, just before a priest kills her with a derringer.
 
In the present, two Jewish American tourists, Rachel Klein (Yael Grobglas) and Sarah Pullman (Danielle Jadelyn), plan a vacation to Tel Aviv. On the plane, they meet a fellow American student named Kevin Reed (Yon Tumarkin). Kevin is fascinated by religious mythology (especially the dark angel, the Golem and the undead or zombies). He suggests that Rachel and Sarah join him on his journey to Jerusalem, and mentions that he wants to spend Yom Kippur there. Sarah becomes infatuated with Kevin and convinces her friend to go to Jerusalem. On their way to the hotel, they meet a local who believes that he is King David. The local warns them to leave the city because it's dangerous, but the friends believe he is insane. In the hotel they meet Omar (Tom Graziani), a local Muslim visitor. While Rachel starts an affair with Omar, Kevin and Sarah grow closer. The four friends enjoy their time in Jerusalem, party, and tour the city.
When they visit the Western Wall, Sarah wishes for her recently dead brother Joel to return. As soon as she puts the paper into the Western Wall, a swarm of black birds fly over the Western Wall. The four friends leave to Zedekiah's Cave|Solomon's Quarries. There Kevin sees drawings on the wall, feels nervous, and leaves to research the drawings in the city's archives. While Sarah joins him, Rachel and Omar stay at the quarries. After investigating, Kevin warns Sarah to leave the city, because after this day there wouldn't be a tomorrow. Sarah also thinks that there is something strange going on but Rachel refuses to leave.
Kevin insists on leaving, but Omar and his father believe that Kevin is crazy and send him to a mental asylum. Later at night, Sarah witnesses Israeli military planes bomb parts of the city. The local media reports it as a potential terrorist attack and that the inhabitants should leave Jerusalem. Sarah tries to set Kevin free from the asylum, but Rachel and Omar, being escorted by two Israeli soldiers, refuse to stop and insist that they keep moving.  Sarah convinces the soldiers to help her free Kevin.
In the hospital, Sarah finds and frees Kevin.  They manage to escape and meet Omar and Rachel at the city walls. However, the city walls are closed and the city is under quarantine. Anyone who tries to leave is brutally shot down. The four friends don't want to give up on their escape, and Omar's father suggests sneaking out through underwater caves he knew as a child.
On their way there they are met by demons who attack the civilians, biting and/or scratching to infect them as well as eat their flesh. Kevin believes that the doors to hell have somehow been opened and that the End of Days has begun. Sarah soon realizes that Rachel has been infected as well when she is scratched by a demon. Kevin warns Sarah that Rachel's condition is contagious and that she will eventually change and attack them. However, Sarah and Kevin decide to take Rachel with them and have her see a doctor once they escape from the city.
In the caves, Rachel's condition worsens. Demons begin to attack the friends and Rachel transforms, her eyes turning black. Sarah falls down and Rachel regains control over herself, warning Sarah to run before killing herself. Sarah accidentally kills Omar's father with a sword taken from a statue, when Omar realizes what happened, he commits suicide rather than being changed into a demon or be eaten alive by the creatures, leaving Kevin and Sarah alone. They meet a creature with black wings who turns out to be Sarah's brother Joel returned to life. Joel leads them from the caves. Upon reaching the other side of the wall, Sarah realizes that she has many scratches similar to Rachel's on her legs and arms. She turns into a demon and flies into the air, while Kevin watches on in shock.
In the final shot, thousands of demons are seen flying above Jerusalem as military helicopters surround the scene and fires burn throughout the city. Jeruzalem Movie

'''''Night of the Living Carrots''''' is a 2011 Halloween short animated film, based on ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' and produced by DreamWorks Animation. Following the 2009 short, ''Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space'', a mutated carrot has spawned hundreds of zombie carrots taking control of the subject's mind. Dr. Cockroach determines that the only way to defeat them and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of the carrots.
The short premiered in two parts exclusively on Nintendo 3DS video service
In a theater, B.O.B. introduces the story parodying typical horror films, with a recap of the events of ''Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space'', and tells the audience to be prepared for a story guaranteed to give them nightmares.
The scene then shifts to the twist ending of the previous special. The Zombie Carrot charges at the camera, but is stopped by a gate slamming into it. Carl Murphy announces to the children of the Modesto suburbs that a costume contest was starting and the winner would get their weight in candy. B.O.B., dressed as a pirate, takes all the candy. Outside, he hears a strange voice and is frightened by the zombie carrot, but mistakes it for a child in a costume. Believing the carrot would win the costume contest, he throws it inside where it immediately bites Carl, turning him into a zombie.
The guests flee the Murphy house and the carrot is blasted by Dr. Cockroach's scanner. Carl snaps out of his zombie state and Doc theorizes that the carrot was contaminated by the mutant pumpkins and the curse could only be lifted by eliminating the infected carrot. However, the remains of the carrot replicate themselves into more zombie carrots, reinfecting Carl. Against Doc's advice, B.O.B. uses the scanner to blast the carrots and before long, B.O.B., Doc and Missing Link are completely surrounded.
General Monger arrives but he falls victim to the zombie carrots. Doc, Link and B.O.B. retreat inside the house to create a barricade. B.O.B.'s bungling leads to Link getting infected and both Doc and B.O.B. retreat to Susan's old room, where a stray zombie carrot seemingly infects B.O.B.; this appears to have no effect however and Doc realizes that B.O.B. is immune because he has no brain. Doc theorizes that the only way to save the day is that B.O.B. must eat all the carrots.
B.O.B. has a flashback revealing a fear of carrots; when he was young, he was force-fed carrot puree by General Monger. B.O.B. is unwilling to eat the carrots and escapes through the window to the roof, but when he sees his zombified friends, he decides to eat the zombie carrots.
B.O.B. eats every zombie carrot, rendering him obese. He is about to eat a "Nutty Buddy Butter Bar" for dessert when he sees his friends are still zombies. The original zombie carrot appears and B.O.B. is unable to pursue due to his weight. The carrot opens the bar, causing B.O.B. to chase it down and eat it whole as a chocolate-covered carrot. Link, Monger and Doc snap out of their zombie-like states and hug B.O.B. causing him to burp out an orange cloud.
Back in the theater, B.O.B. reminds the audience to eat your veggies, or they just might eat you, but his shadow morphs into a zombie carrot.

'''''A Christmas Horror Story''''' is a 2015 anthology horror film directed by Grant Harvey, Steven Hoban, and Brett Sullivan. The film is a series of interwoven stories tied together by a framework story featuring William Shatner as a radio DJ.
Dangerous Dan (William Shatner) is a radio DJ stuck pulling a long shift at the Bailey Downs radio station during Christmas. During his broadcast, a series of four stories are witnessed:
Dylan (Shannon Kook), Ben (Alex Ozerov), and Molly Simon (Zoé De Grand Maison) have decided to break into their school, which used to be a convent, in order to investigate two murders that occurred in the school's basement the year prior. Their friend Caprice (Amy Forsyth) was supposed to go, but she has to go with her parents out of town. The three of them end up getting locked in the basement. Molly becomes possessed after witnessing a bloody ghost and tries to seduce the others. When Dylan refuses her, Molly kills him. Ben agrees to have sex and after the act is finished, the ghost leaves Molly's body. Upon waking Molly reveals that the ghost is actually a pregnant teenager who died back when the school was a convent after the convent's nuns gave her a gruesome surgery to remove the baby. The ghost is only interested in having someone give birth to her child and if someone refuses, they're murdered - explaining last year's deaths. Despite impregnating Molly, the ghost still kills Ben before she unlocks the door and allows Molly to leave.
Scott (Adrian Holmes) is a police officer, but this doesn't stop him from going into woods owned by "Big Earl" (Alan C. Peterson) with his family to illegally chop down a Christmas tree for his family. During the trek, Scott's son Will (Orion John) wanders off and is lost. He and his wife Kim 
(Olunike Adeliyi) manage to find Will inside of a tree and are overjoyed to find him. This joy is short lived after Will begins to act strangely, culminating in Big Earl contacting the family to warn them that Will is actually a changeling. After the changeling kills Scott, Kim brings the changeling to Big Earl, who states that he's unable to help her find her son because it is up to the changelings. This ultimately ends with Kim shooting Big Earl, who was actually the changeling's abusive master. Finally free, the changeling returns to his home and frees Will.
Caprice and Duncan (Percy Hynes White) are traveling with their parents in order to visit their elderly Aunt Etta (Corrine Conley). During their visit, Etta tells them about the mythological creature Krampus (Rob Archer), which frightens Caprice - especially after Duncan purposely misbehaves in an attempt to irritate Etta's caretaker Gerhardt (Julian Richings). Their parents decide to take the children home at Etta's insistence but on the way the family ends up getting into a car accident, making it necessary for them to walk. Aware that they were being hunted by Krampus because they acted badly, the family members take refuge in a church where they confessed their sins in belief that Krampus will leave them if they do so. However, they are picked off one by one until only Caprice remains. Caprice manages to flee to Great Aunt Etta's house. She is successful in killing Krampus who transforms into Gerhardt. It's revealed that he transformed into Krampus due to his anger over the family's actions and that Etta was fully aware that this would happen. Furious, Caprice's anger causes her to transform into Krampus and she attacks Etta.
While preparing for a busy Christmas, Santa Claus (George Buza) discovers that all of his elves and his wife have turned into zombies after one of the infected elves dies following a fit of rage. He manages to kill them all, but is then forced to fight against Krampus. However, during the battle, it's revealed that "Santa" is actually a Mall Santa named Norman (who was an earlier guest on Dangerous Dan's radio show) that had a psychotic break while working overtime that caused him to see regular mall goers as zombies during the Christmas Food Drive. The police arrive and manage to gun him down just as he's about to kill "Krampus", revealed to be the mall's manager Mr. Taylor. This is the disturbance at the mall that Dangerous Dan has been mentioning through his broadcast.

''Wasteland'' premiered at the Festival of Zombie Culture on 16 November 2013.
HorrorNews.net initially disliked the film upon their first viewing, but upon seeing it a second time they felt that it was "definitely not an exciting, action-packed, zombie flick. It is a slow burn of a film that explores the end-of-the-world questions".

'''''28 Weeks Later''''' is a 2007 British science fiction horror film, structured as a sequel to the critically and commercially successful 2002 film ''28 Days Later''. ''28 Weeks Later'' was co-written and directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, with Danny Boyle and Alex Garland, director and writer of ''28 Days Later'' respectively, now acting as executive producers. It was released in the United Kingdom and United States on 11 May 2007. The plot depicts the efforts of NATO military forces to salvage a safe zone in London following the events in ''28 Days Later'', the consequence of two young siblings breaking protocol to find their infected mother, and the resulting reintroduction of the highly contagious virus to the safe zone.
During the 28 Days Later#Plot|original outbreak of the Rage Virus, Don, his wife Alice, and four other survivors hide in a barricaded cottage on the outskirts of London. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door and let him in. A few minutes later, they discover that the infected have followed the boy to them. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors, while Don, Alice, and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice to abandon the boy, but she refuses. He abandons them as the infected break into their room by busting out of the window. Don desperately sprints to a nearby motorboat, narrowly escaping after a tussle with a recently turned survivor.
After the infected begin to die of starvation, NATO forces take control of Great Britain. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American-led force, under the command of Brigadier General Stone, brings in settlers. Among the new arrivals are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy, who were out of the country during the outbreak. They are admitted to District One, a safe zone on the Isle of Dogs guarded by the U.S. Army. Sergeant Doyle, a U.S. Delta Force Sniper and his friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter pilot, are amongst the military presence in charge of guarding the district. Tammy and Andy are reunited with their father, who was found by the U.S. Army and has become the district's caretaker. In their new flat, Don fabricates a lie about the circumstances surrounding their mother's death.
That night, Andy dreams about forgetting his mother's face, so Tammy and Andy sneak out of the safe zone, and return to their former home, where they begin to collect family photographs and other mementos. To his shock, Andy finds Alice alive and uninfected in a semi-conscious, delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where she is tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the rage virus.  Don makes an unauthorised visit to Alice in her isolation cell, begging her to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him. However, when they kiss, Don is infected, savagely kills her, and goes on a rampage.
General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and District One to be put into Code Red lockdown. Civilians are herded into safe rooms, but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room containing a large crowd and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The mob - now with half its members infected - breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a U.S. Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy, and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. General Stone orders District One to be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but he refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who are possibly infected.
Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to head to Wembley Stadium, but to leave the civilians. Doyle ignores his instructions and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape nerve gas released to kill the infected, but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the car and is subsequently roasted alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the London Underground, where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy. Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the English Channel to France, as previously instructed by Doyle.
Twenty-eight days later, a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen running through a tunnel which, as they emerge into the open, is revealed to be the exit of the Paris Métro Trocadéro (Paris Métro)|Trocadéro Station with a view of the nearby Eiffel Tower.

In 2003, plans for the film were conceived after the international success of ''28 Days Later''. Danny Boyle, Andrew Macdonald and Alex Garland stated that they felt the time was right to make a sequel.
In March 2005, Boyle said in an interview that he would not direct the sequel due to commitments to ''Sunshine'' (2007), but he would serve as executive producer. He also revealed that the film would revolve around the aftermath of the first movie.
Both Fresnadillo and Lopez-Lavigne were involved in writing the script, which revolved around a family and what happened to them in the aftermath of the original film, which the producers "liked a lot".
Boyle said in March 2005 that the sequel would feature a new cast, since previous cast members Cillian Murphy, Megan Burns, and Naomie Harris were occupied with their own projects. On 23 August 2006, Jeremy Renner was announced to portray Doyle, one of the principal characters for ''28 Weeks Later''.
On 1 September 2006, principal photography for ''28 Weeks Later'' began in London with much of the filming taking place at Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs, the safe zone in the film's plot.
The on-location filming took place in London and 3 Mills Studios, although scenes intended to be shot at Wembley Stadium, then undergoing final stages of a major reconstruction, were filmed instead in Wales, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium used as a replacement.
On 13 April 2007, 28 days before the release of the film in UK cinemas, a huge biohazard warning sign was projected against the White Cliffs of Dover. The sign contained the international biological hazard symbol, along with the admonition that Britain was "contaminated, keep out!"
In July 2006, Fox Atomic Comics and publisher HarperCollins announced the publication, in early 2007, of ''28 Days Later: The Aftermath'', a graphic novel bridging the gap between ''28 Days Later'' and ''28 Weeks Later''. Motion comics of two segments of the graphic novel were added to the DVD & Blu-ray release of ''28 Weeks Later''. ''28 Weeks Later'' Blu-Ray Review
Removable chalk-powder graffiti was sprayed in locations around London and Birmingham featuring the web address www.ragevirus.com. However, the web address was found to be unregistered and was quickly snapped up. The advertising agency who made the mistake agreed to purchase the rights to the domain name for an undisclosed sum.
In April 2007, the horror/science-fiction film website ''Bloody Disgusting'' promoted ''28 Weeks Later'' by giving readers a chance to win a prop from the film. The props were included in a "District 1 Welcome Pack", which featured an ID card and an edition of the London ''Evening Standard'' newspaper with a headline proclaiming the evacuation. The giveaway was only open to residents of North America, and entries closed on 9 May 2007.
In May 2007, 20th Century Fox posted a free ''28 Weeks Later''-themed flash game on their international website, foxinternational.com. In the game, the player can play one of the infected in three parts of the city.
''28 Weeks Later'' gained generally positive reviews.
The film opened in 2,000 cinemas across the United States.
1.3 million DVD units have been sold in the United States, gathering a revenue of $24.3 million, as of July 2010. The film has been released as its own DVD and as a double feature with ''28 Days Later''.
:
'''''28 Weeks Later: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was composed, written and performed by John Murphy. The score was released exclusively to iTunes on 12 June 2007. On 2 June 2009, a limited edition soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records. Only 1500 copies were made..
The film's theatrical trailer featured the songs "Want" (Witchman) and "Shrinking Universe" (Muse).
Fox Atomic stated in June 2007 that they would consider producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well.
On 13 April 2013, Boyle stated: "[I]t's 40/60 whether [a sequel] happens or not. But we did have an idea of where to set it and what it might be about." When asked to share that idea, Boyle laughed and said, "No, because they'll end up in ''The Walking Dead''."

'''''The Girl with All the Gifts''''' is a 2016 British Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic zombie horror drama film directed by Colm McCarthy and written by M.R. Carey adapted from his novel of the same name. Starring Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine, Glenn Close, and Sennia Nanua, the plot depicts a dystopian future following a breakdown of society after most of humanity is wiped out by a fungal infection and focuses upon the struggle of a scientist, a teacher and two soldiers who embark on a journey of survival with a special young girl named Melanie.
In the near future, humanity has been ravaged by a mysterious fungal disease. The afflicted are robbed of all free will and turned into fast, flesh-eating zombies referred to as 'hungries'. Humankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid, second generation children who crave living flesh but retain the ability to think and learn. The children go to "school" at an army base in the Home Counties, where they are subjected to experiments by Dr. Caroline Caldwell. The children are treated as prisoners, but humanized by Helen to the dismay of Sgt. Eddie Parks, although they are all restrained in cells, wheelchairs, and under constant armed guard. Helen Justineau is responsible for educating and studying the children. Helen treats the children fairly and kindly, growing particularly close to a polite, exceptional girl named Melanie, who is shown to have a high level IQ and the two form a special bond. Helen tells a story at the pleading of Melanie about the myth of Pandora's Box. After Melanie reads a story she has written about a young girl saving a woman from a monster and the pair staying together forever (clearly drawing a parallel from her own feelings for Miss Justineau), Helen is overcome with emotion and affectionately strokes the girl's head. Sgt. Parks bursts in and severely rebukes Helen; he spits on his arm, rubbing off the masking gel and holds it under the nose of one of the children, evoking a violent, animalistic response from the child that spreads to the others, apart from Melanie who alone struggles to restrain herself, retaining her humanity to impress Helen. 
Dr Caldwell is revealed to be researching an antidote by experimenting on the children. Caldwell gives Melanie riddles and puzzles, which her high IQ allows her to solve with her exceptional logic and reasoning. One day Caldwell asks Melanie for a number between one and twenty - Melanie chooses thirteen, and the child in cell thirteen is then absent the following day. The next time Caldwell asks Melanie for a number, she is surprised when Melanie chooses her own cell number (four). Caldwell reluctantly takes her to her lab, whereupon Melanie sees a preserved brain belonging to child thirteen. As she is strapped to a table, Helen rushes into the lab and tries to intervene to save her as it is revealed that Dr Caldwell intends to remove Melanie's brain and spinal column to develop a possible vaccine. Helen is tricked then easily disarmed but the base has been overrun as the fences gave way and the lab is breached before Caldwell can proceed. Melanie escapes the lab but outside the hungries are everywhere and soldiers are being swarmed and violently attacked in a failing, chaotic mass breach. 
Melanie wanders stunned by what she sees, but then violently attacks and infects two soldiers who are trying to restrain Helen. Helen and Melanie jump aboard an escaping armoured van. Dr Caldwell, Sgt Parks, and Privates Kieran Gallagher and Dillon reluctantly allow Helen and Melanie into the vehicle, and the group escape the base into the outskirt wilderness. The group reach a river to collect water but get attacked by hungries who have come out of the woods. The group is surrounded by more hungries and defend themselves but Parks is forced to shoot Private Dillon who has been bitten and has started to succumb to the quick-acting fungal pathogen. Afterwards, when Parks asks Dr. Caldwell why there were so many hungries travelling in a group, Melanie speaks up saying, "they must be lonely."
As the van is now broken down, the group proceed to London on foot where there is greater likelihood of food and supplies and where they can better communicate with Beacon, a larger military base. They discover London (which is overgrown with wild, unkempt vegetation) populated with multitudes of dormant, unstimulated hungries. By using a gel that blocks their scent and moving quietly, they manage to sneak past the hungries, shooting several in the head along the way, eventually finding shelter in an abandoned hospital. When they try to leave the next day, they realize the hospital has been surrounded by a greater horde of hungries, possibly from their gunfire the day before. Melanie offers to lead the hungries away - as she alone cannot be attacked, essentially by being one - and the group agrees. She wanders around the area, exploring houses and experiencing childish wonder at the domestic and everyday objects she has never before encountered. She chases and devours a cat, then captures a small dog to use as bait to distract and lure the hungries away from the hospital so the group can escape.
As they progress through London they come across a mass of decomposing, infected bodies encircling the completely overgrown BT Tower and sprouting with seed pods. Caldwell explains to the group that the pods contain spores that if released could end humankind, as the fungal pathogen will become airborne and infect all who breath. They find a mobile, military lab truck whose original crew has gone missing. The group hole up and Melanie asks to leave to get food as she is finding her urge to feed overpowering. Melanie discovers a group of feral, second generation child hungries, who've learnt to recognize uninfected humans from the scent masking cream of the missing lab crew members. She returns to the lab to warn the group that Kieran, who has also set off in search of food, is in danger and is being hunted by the ferals. Helen and Parks set off with Melanie but arrive too late and find Kieran's body ravaged and the feral child hungries surrounding them. Melanie manages to scare and dominate the hungries off by battling their leader to the death and allowing her to lead Helen and Parks to safety. 
When they return to the lab they are ambushed and knocked out by gas that a haz-mat suited Caldwell has released. A severely injured Caldwell, who has blood poisoning from a previous arm wound, attempts to drag Melanie into the lab but Melanie awakens quickly, revealing that her second generation bio-system metabolizes oxygen differently allowing her to hold her breath much longer than the uninfected humans. Caldwell explains that she is dying of her septic wound and needs to find the cure before she succumbs, before the pods ever open, which will eventually happen when they are exposed to extreme heat or water. She tries to reason that she can save Helen and the human race for Melanie by making a vaccine. Melanie asks if Caldwell now believes Melanie is truly alive and feeling, rather than simply "mimicking human emotions" as Caldwell once believed. When Caldwell admits that she knows Melanie is truly alive, Melanie asks why her kind should die to save humanity. Melanie then threatens Caldwell with a bite and leaves the lab, running back to the centre of London where she sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to germinate en masse and release an immense cloud of airborne spore mist. Dr Caldwell, meanwhile, has attempted to follow Melanie but is surrounded by the feral children and killed. As Melanie returns to the lab she finds Sgt Parks collapsed along the way succumbing to the fungal infection of the released mist. They talk and Melanie finally understands of the root cause of his animosity towards her and her kind: he lost his wife who was 7 months pregnant to the infection; it is hinted that the newborn feasted as it emerged, surviving by burrowing out of the womb of the infected mother, as was indeed the case with Melanie and all other "second-generation" hungries. This was also revealed to Melanie by Dr. Caldwell in an earlier conversation. Sgt Parks asks her to not let him succumb to the fungal virus and Melanie grants him his wish by regretfully shooting him. 
The film closes with a tearful Helen awakening in the lab, secure from infection in the airlock of the mobile lab but effectively a prisoner inside the mobile med lab. Outside on chairs are the second generation children of the school/prison at the army base, along with the feral children all waiting and collected together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Helen begins speaking through a microphone on outside speakers, once again to educate and teach all the children. It closes with Melanie asking for her favourite, a story, and after being kindly declined by Helen says that they now have "plenty of time" to hear one.

The book and film were written in tandem, with Carey also writing the screenplay, which was placed on the 2014 Brit List, a film-industry-compiled list of the best unproduced screenplays in British film. Colm McCarthy came aboard as director for his first major feature.
On 23 March 2015, casting was announced for the film.
Half of the film's £4 million budget came from the BFI Film Fund and Creative England, making it the biggest investment that the latter had ever made and one of the largest ever for the BFI. Warner Bros. bought the United Kingdom distribution rights, while the film is being distributed in the United States by Saban Films.
Principal photography began on 17 May 2015 in The West Midlands, taking place in Birmingham city centre,  Cannock Chase, Dudley and Stoke-on-Trent. Aerial views of a deserted London were filmed with drones in the abandoned Ukrainian town of Pripyat, which has been uninhabited since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
''The Girl with All the Gifts'' received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85%, based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.
Dave Robinson of ''Crash Landed'' described the film as a "tense and intriguing experience" noting that whilst its final act "goes a little off the reservation" the performance of lead Sennia Nanua will "make you both care [for her] and simultaneously feel on edge" along with the "smart choices" in the CGI department to create a "grounded feel" that offers clear similarities to ''28 Days Later''.

'''''The Rezort''''' is a 2015 British zombie horror film directed by Steve Barker and written by Paul Gerstenberger. It stars Dougray Scott, Jessica De Gouw and Martin McCann.  After humanity wins a devastating war against zombies, the few remaining undead are kept on a secure island, where they are hunted for sport.  When something goes wrong with the island's security, the guests must face the possibility of a new outbreak.
After humanity wins a war against zombies, tourists are able to kill zombies for sport at the Rezort.  Guests include couple Lewis and Melanie, who want to conquer Melanie's psychological issues caused by the zombie war; Archer, a quiet veteran; Jack and Alfie, teenage video gamers; and Sadie, whose ex-fiance dumped her prior to their wedding.  After the group meets the owner of the resort, Valerie Wilton, Archer sees Sadie sneak into a control room.  There, she hacks into a mainframe, causing the system to become erratic.  The engineers, scared they could lose their jobs due to careless system security, keep quiet about the problems as they attempt to fix the system.
After meeting their guide, Nevins, the guests leave the resort to hunt zombies.  The first group of zombies are restrained in place and easily killed.  The second group roam freely, and the guests snipe at them from a safe distance.  Despite Lewis' urging, Melanie can not bring herself to shoot one.  Archer surprises the others by scoring many rapid head shots, explaining that he has come to the resort because killing zombies is the only thing he was ever good at.  Nevins leads them to a safe spot, and they camp for the night.  When they can not sleep, Melanie and Sadie discuss the ethics of killing zombies for sport, and Sadie says she believes it leads to a decreased inhibition to harm the living.
After several system failures, the resort's security system goes offline.  Zombies are released from their fenced-in pens, killing the guests and staff in the resort.  Wilton escapes to her office, sealing the door behind her and dooming the remaining engineers.  The guests outside the resort in the safari do not realize what has happened until the now-freed zombies attack them.  Alfie is killed in the melee.  Nevins tells them the entire island will be firebombed in several hours as a failsafe, and their only hope is to escape to the docks.  Nevins' SUV fails to start, and Archer leads them on foot toward the docks.  As they pass through a security checkpoint, Nevins is bitten.  Lewis angers Melanie when he kills Nevins with a head shot.
At the security tunnels that lead back to the resort, Archer threatens to leave Sadie behind unless she reveals her involvement in the resort's problems.  She admits to being a member of a zombie rights activist group and says she merely copied documents from the resort's mainframe to prove the resort's danger.  Jack says she has been used to inject a virus in the system and cause the destruction of the resort.  Although angry at her actions, Melanie promises Sadie  she will not be left behind.  After zombies attack, the guests split up in the tunnels; Archer, Melanie, and Lewis go one way, and Jack and Sadie another.  Sadie is bitten and sacrifices herself to give Jack time to escape.  Before she dies, she gives him her evidence.
Jack rejoins the others, and they enter the resort.  After wandering through a security area, they discover the resort has been using a charitable front organization to lure refugees to the island, where they are transformed into zombies.  Jack is bitten, and Archer kills him.  As Archer and Melanie hold back zombies, Lewis abandons them.  Archer tells Melanie to flee to the docks and apparently sacrifices himself.  Near the control room, Melanie encounters Lewis, who has subsequently been bitten.  Instead of killing him, she hands him her pistol, and he reluctantly shoots himself.
Before Melanie is also bitten, Wilton rescues her.  Melanie accuses her of being worse than the zombies, some of whom break in and ignore Melanie in their zeal to kill Wilton.  Melanie barely escapes the resort in time to avoid the firebombing.  After being rescued, she reveals the extent of the resort's crimes; Archer - revealed to have also escaped - watches her on television.  Melanie says that in winning the war, people lost their humanity.  After Melanie warns of a new zombie war, the news program cuts to a live feed in which zombies are revealed to be attacking people on a beach.

'''''Ojuju''''' is a 2014 Nigerian zombie thriller film, written and directed by C.J. Obasi. The film which has a No budget film|zero-budget, stars Gabriel Afolayan, Omowunmi Dada, and Kelechi Udegbe. It premiered at the 4th Africa International Film Festival, where it won the award for "Best Nigerian Movie".

*Emeka Okoye as The Chemist

C.J. Obasi had been visiting a friend in a slum location. He observed unique features of the area; which included for example, the area has a single point of entry and exit, the area also had only one source of water, which everyone fetched from. Obasi then decided to develop a story based on this premise, since it was feasible to create a story based on the consequences of pollution to the common Nigerian. In an interview, Obasi stated that he chose the name "''Ojuju''" because he didn't want to use the word "zombies" in any manner or form, as he believed that if such an outbreak occurred in the slums of Lagos, the "Zombie" word would hardly be used to describe it. Obasi also felt it would be more realistic to eliminate any supernatural elements to the plot, and localize the Zombie genre for the Nigerian environment, rather than trying to do a Hollywood-version of what a zombie film ought to be.
 
The first actor to be cast in ''Ojuju'' was Gabriel Afolayan, who play the lead character of Romero in the film. Next was Paul Utomi, an actor who Obasi had wanted to work with for some time. Other members of the main cast, including Omowunmi Dada and Yvonne Enakhena, were in an open audition for the film.
Principal photography for Ojuju began in November 2013, in a close-knit slum location in Ikeja, Lagos. Additional establishment scenes were shot around Bariga, while the police station scenes were shot in "Compact E-Schedular", a film and television production company at Opebi, Ikeja in February 2014. Initial budget for the film was ?5,000,000 ($30,000); however, no investor showed any interest in funding the film. Eventually, Obasi, along with Oge Obasi, the producer of the film struck pro bono deals regarding equipment leasing, and with cast and crew. Most of the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of the slum, where the film was shot.
The film was scored by  Wache Pollen, with additional soundtrack by Beatoven. Original background scores were composed by David Jones David. The lyrics of the closing song "Run Things" was penned by C.J. Obasi.
A teaser trailer for ''Ojuju'' was released to the public on 10 August 2014. The film premiered at the 2014 Africa International Film Festival on 11 November 2014.
Todd Brown of Twitch Film concludes: "There is no question at all that ''Ojuju'' has its limitations. But it also shows a clarity of vision and a broad base of skills that mark Obasi as a director to watch out for".

'''''Seoul Station'''''  (
The film serves as the prequel to the live-action film ''Train to Busan'' by the same director.
Taking place in and around Seoul station, a homeless man is the catalyst for a zombie apocalypse. Through this a young runaway woman must try to survive in a world that sees her as disposable.
The story revolves around two main characters: Suk-gyu (voiced by Seung-ryong Ryu), a father who searches for his runaway daughter (Hye-Sun, voiced by Shim Eun-kyung), only to discover she has become a prostitute. Just as he is about to be reunited with her, a zombie epidemic breaks out in Seoul.
The film begins in front of Seoul Station's terminal building as a bloodied man collapses. A fashionable young man, in the middle of telling his friend how he believes in universal healthcare, steps forward to look but turns away after seeing that it is just a "stinky homeless guy". The dying man's younger brother runs around asking for help from people, yet is refused. Further, he is frowned at by social workers, denigrated by police officers and roughed up by hoodlums.
The old man soon becomes a savage, blood-lusting zombie, setting off chaos that sweeps through the station, first among those squatting in the corridors and then among everybody in the terminal's vicinity. It's against this backdrop that the protagonists make their entry. Hye-sun has just run away from her previous life of quasi-slavery at a brothel, and is now living with her good-for-nothing boyfriend, Ki-woong (voiced by Lee Joon), whose idea of earning a living is pimping out Hye-sun online. After a fight about this, the pair separate and are swept up in the chaos bursting out of Seoul Station. Hye-sun witnesses and narrowly escapes a bloodbath up close at the local police station, while Ki-woong's search for Hye-sun is bolstered by the appearance of Suk-gyu. As the trio race around town to flee the undead and find each other, they run into extreme measures put in place to contain what the authorities consider an insurrection. The undead and the survivors find themselves up against barricades manned by fully armed soldiers with their tanks, water cannons and live ammunition.

It won the Grand Prize at the Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer in February 2014.  ''Paris Match'', 3 February 2014

The film was reviewed favourably at variety.com : - "the low-budget film suggests a cross between Lucky McKee's "The Woman" and Jonathan Levine's "Warm Bodies,"  Miss Zombie's exploitation by her "owners" even recalls recent realist dramas about foreign domestic helpers (some scenarios are almost identical to those in Cannes Camera d'Or winner "Ilo Ilo". "Komatsu (Shara) interprets the character's transformation - from a stiff, marionette-like figure to someone driven by love and altruism - with a sullen intensity made even more effective by her lack of dialogue. Komatsu made her name as a "gravure idol" (a particular type of pin-up girl in Japan),  "and some of her scenes with Teramoto cheekily channel certain genres of Japanese erotica."

'''''Mulberry Street''''' is a 2006 American horror film directed by Jim Mickle, written by Nick Damici and Jim Mickle, and starring Nick Damici. It was released by After Dark Films as a part of their ''8 Films to Die For 2007''.
Set during a long and hot summer day and night, a deadly infection breaks out on Mulberry Street in downtown Manhattan, causing humans to devolve into blood-thirsty monstrosities. Most of the information in the film comes from TV news broadcasts where as a result of constant urban decay, pollution and unbearable heat, the sewer rats of Manhattan are quickly spreading an unknown and horrible disease that causes its victims to mutate into a ravenous and bloodthirsty rat-creatures. Once bitten, people quickly turn into rabid-like creatures with the appearance and eating habits of rats, and they only look at their former friends and neighbors as a source of food. Clutch, a retired boxer, nervously awaits the homecoming of his soldier daughter, Casey, recently back from a tour of duty in Iraq, but first he has to protect the other tenants as the rat-zombies are quickly infesting the entire neighborhood.
Initially emergency services and city authorities attempt to contain the spread by shutting down public transportation, and closing roads, but soon hospitals are inundated with the wounded, and the virus begins to spread island wide. By the time Clutch and the rest of the film's characters realize the severity of the situation, the infected have overrun much of the city and the streets are highly dangerous, with police seemingly overwhelmed and unable to respond. The survivors barricade themselves in their apartments as the news of the outbreak and subsequent quarantine of Manhattan breaks on TV and radio, waiting on promised rescue from the military, which the government promises will begin to restore order in Manhattan soon.

Jim Mickle and Nick Damici met while working on a student thesis film.  They came up with the idea of a back-to-basics zombie film called ''Dead of Night'', but the estimated budget was too high for them.  Tim House, who played the super, offered to put up $10,000, and the concept and style were reworked to fit around that budget.  Eventually, the film grew from there and morphed into something less traditional.  Many of the characters were based on people they knew from the real apartment building, and the actors were made up of friends and family.  The film was shot in three and a half weeks.
Damici and Mickle had to fight to keep the title, as their representatives wanted to title it something more evocative of the current horror boom.  Damici and Mikle, however, wanted to emphasize the theme of gentrification.
''Mulberry Street'' premiered at the Stockholm International Film Festival on November 16, 2006.  It got a theatrical release through After Dark Films on November 9, 2007.
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 70% of ten surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.9/10.

'''''The Plague of the Zombies''''' is a 1966 Hammer film directed by John Gilling. It stars André Morell, John Carson, Jacqueline Pearce, Brook Williams and Michael Ripper. The film's imagery influenced many later films in the zombie genre.
In a Cornish village in August 1860, the inhabitants of the town are dying from a mysterious plague that seems to be spreading at an accelerated rate. Even the local doctor, Peter Tompson (Brook Williams), cannot combat the disease. Alarmed, Tompson sends for outside help from his friend Sir James Forbes (André Morell). Accompanying Sir James is his daughter Sylvia (Diane Clare). In an attempt to learn more about the disease, Sir James and Dr. Thompson disinter the corpses that were recently buried. To their surprise, the men find all the coffins empty. Conducting further investigations on the mystery lead the doctors to encounter zombies walking near an old, deserted tin mine on the estate of Squire Clive Hamilton (John Carson). Sir James is informed that the squire lived in Haiti for several years and practiced voodoo rituals, as well as black magic. This information leads him to research on the subject of the black arts.
Later that evening, Squire Hamilton pays Sylvia a visit. Purposely, Hamilton manages to shatter a wine glass, and Sylvia happens to cut her finger on one of the sharp edges of the glass. Secretly, the Squire conceals a piece of the blood-stained glass into his coat pocket and departs. With a vestige of Sylvia's blood, Hamilton uses his voodoo magic to lure the heroine into venturing in the dark woods. She is led to the abandoned tin mine by an army of walking zombies for a voodoo ceremony that will transform her into one of the walking dead. 
While Tompson follows Sylvia to the mines, Sir James investigates the Squire's house and finds some small figures in coffins the Squire uses for his voodoo. After a struggle with one of the Squire's henchmen the room is accidentally set ablaze, Sir James barely managing to escape after threatening a servant who notices the inferno for information on the mine. He races to the mines to join Tompson, while in the mansion the figures in the coffins catch fire, causing their zombie counterparts to do the same and go crazy. Using the distraction caused by the burning crazed zombies Sir James and the doctor rescue Sylvia and flee from the burning flames as they listen to the anguished screams of Hamilton and his zombies; thus the plague is ended.

'''''Zoombies''''' is a 2016 American low-budget film|low-budget science fiction zombie film directed by Glenn R. Miller and written by Scotty Mullen. The story follows a small staff and some visitors of a to-be-opened zoo affected by a mysterious virus which turns the animals into meat-seeking aggressive zombies.
The Eden Wildlife Zoo, a refuge for endangered animals, is about to be opened to the public. The film starts with Dr. Ellen Rogers, who inherited the zoo from her grandfather, announcing the coming opening of the park on a TV commercial. 
Some of the zoo's monkeys are infected by an unknown disease. They are taken to the veterinarian clinic, where Dr. Gordon uses intracardiac epinephrine, a forbidden serum, in order to save the life of a monkey who suffered a cardiac arrest. The contagious pathogen spreads to other monkeys in the room, causing their eyes to become white and their body to appear dark and dirty and their behavior to become predatory towards humans. They violently attack and apparently kill everyone in the room.  
A group of zoology college students are visiting Eden Wildlife Zoo for internship, while it is still private. They are led by Ellen, who is also taking care of her young daughter Thea. After arriving the zoo, the students take different parts to serve different areas of the park. Chelsea the birdkeeper shows the zoo's aviary to Ricky, a student fascinated with birds. It is revealed that Amber, a political sciences major doing zoology for internship, is secretly on probation for small offenses. It is shown that Thea has a long friendship with Kifo, the zoo's endangered Cross River gorilla. 
The zoo's security team, which is composed of Rex, Boris, Ty and Lizzy, receives an alarm coming from the clinic room and no one responds on the walkie-talkies. They head there with Gage, one of the students, to check out what's happening. There they find a bloody Dr. Gordon and his assistants Johnny and Robin dead. An infected monkey appears from the insides of the doctor's body, and the other monkeys are revealed to be in the room. They violently confront the team, killing Boris and Ty. Three of them eventually escape and began infecting the rest of the zoo. Ellen shoots an alarm to warn everyone in the park to seek a closed shelter. 
Wild hogs try to attack Amber and two other students, who manage to escape by climbing a tree. However, they are attacked again by infected giraffes, who kill the two Amber's colleagues. The security team arrives with Gage and shoot the giraffes to death, saving Amber. Among a subsequent giraffe attack, Amber steals the team's jeep after she decided to escape the zoom quickly, depleting them of transport and equipment. They meet a pack of non-affected elephants, which they decide to use as transport.
A police team arrives the zoo, but is all-killed by infected lions when trying to approach them in the zoo's warehouse. Amber arrives the zoo's locked gate, and is attacked by an infected gray wolf when desperately trying to get to the other side. Thea is subsequently attacked by an infected koala who climbed the watchtower where Ellen and her stood, but manages to kill it. While riding the elephants, Rex, Lizzy and Gage are attacked by infected lemurs, but lately saved by AJ, one of the students and Daxton, one of the zookeepers. It is told that the CDC will only arrive within two more hours.
Rex, Lizzy, Gage, AJ and Daxton shelter in the gorilla lab near Kifo's exhibit. But the gorilla is revealed to be also infected, and kills Daxton after he approaches the primate and runs to the lab. With everyone threatened, Rex stabs Kifo, but the gorilla subsequently detaches his head. The rest manage to push a heavy rock into Kifo and escape his exhibit. The three then heard a jeep coming in, with a dying and feeble Amber driving. She soon dies, while the group is approached by a group of lions. When some of the lions feed on Amber's corpse, they rush in the jeep to escape while chase by the lions. Lizzy and Gage manage to shoot and kill one of the incoming predators. 
Ellen tells Chelsea to set the birds free to avoid their infection, and says that a sample she took of the infected koala's blood revealed that an unknown enzyme infected the animal's cerebral cortex. While the infected birds began trying to escape the highly protected aviary by breaking the glass, AJ, Lizzy and Gage try to use an unfinished zip line to get to the watchtower, but the rope breaks in the process, causing AJ to fall to his death. In the town, They join Ellen and Thea and prepare to set fire to the aviary by using flammable gas cans from the tower's basement. After Chelsea does not respond to the walkie-talkie, Lizzy and Gage go to the aviary to check for her, and Lizzy tells Ellen to destroy it if they do not come back. Lizzy and Gage find Chelsea and Ricky laid dying inside the aviary, with an infected parrot and his nest made above Chelsea's guts. Ellen sets the aviary on fire, and Lizzy and Gage manage to escape before she leaves in the jeep. When realizing the fire won't reach some of the birds on fire, the group explodes the jeep to cause an additional, quicker fire. 
Kifo, revealed to be alive, chases the group into the zoo's gate. Ellen manages to shoot down the gorilla after he relentlessly tries to attack them. A helicopter then arrives and rescues the four. Ellen resents this because she feels she ruined her grandfather's dream, but the others comfort her saying she did the right thing. In the final scene, Kifo is revealed to be still alive.

Six years have passed since the events at Hull House on Halloween, and many of the bodies left at Hull House were recovered except for Angela's; rumor persists she descended bodily into Hell. As it turns out, her parents committed suicide five years later after receiving a Halloween card with Angela's signature. A year later her sister Melissa, nicknamed 'Mouse' (Merle Kennedy), is now staying at St. Rita's Academy, a Catholic boarding school for troubled teenagers. She frequently has nightmares about her sister. Rumors spread around the school regarding Mouse, started by the school bully, Shirley (Zoe Trilling). However, the head nun at the school, Sister Gloria (Jennifer Rhodes), tries to put an end to it.
However, Shirley, after getting banned from the school Halloween dance for wrestling on the tennis courts with Kurt (Ladd York) decides to have her own Halloween party at Hull House complete with Mouse and some ritual sacrifice she learns from stealing a demonic ritual book from the school brain, Perry (Robert Jayne). Along with her boyfriend Rick (Rick Peters) and Z-Boy (Darin Heames), she tricks Johnny (Johnny Moran), Johnny's girlfriend, Bibi (Cristi Harris), and Bibi's friend Terri (Christine Taylor) to get Mouse to go with them to Hull House, awakening a now demonized Angela. After some bizarre incidents, the group flees the house, minus Z-Boy, who is possessed and raped by Angela in the attic.
Bibi brings a tube of lipstick out of the house which takes on a hellish life of its own. It quickly possesses Shirley and, one by one, the teenagers are possessed and/or murdered by demonic Angela. Her plan is to sacrifice Mouse to the Devil to prove her devotion to him. Sister Gloria, Johnny, Bibi, Father Bob (Rod McCary) and Perry return to Hull House in an attempt to rescue Melissa. Once arriving at the house, the five become separated and Father Bob is quickly killed by the demonic Rick. Johnny is saved by Perry from the demonic Kurt. Unfortunately, Perry is killed by Z-Boy. With the holy water the group brought, Bibi, Johnny and Sister Gloria kill the remaining demons, except for Angela.
After finishing off the demons, the three survivors find Melissa sleeping on an altar. Angela and Sister Gloria debate on what true faith is with Angela stating "Real faith can move mountains, your faith can't even move a mouse." Angela then decapitates Sister Gloria but the sister actually pulls her head down into her habit and survives. With one last ruse to save Melissa and the others, Sister Gloria agrees to take her place on the altar. Angela then hands the sword to Melissa, promising her a great source of power if she kills Sister Gloria. However, Melissa turns the tables and stabs Angela instead. Sister Gloria finishes Angela off with a super soaker filled with holy water. As the four try to leave, they are confronted again by Angela, who has taken the form of a Lamia. Angela attacks them but Johnny manages to kick a hole in the wall in the shape of a cross. The cross-shaped-sunlight falls upon Angela and she explodes. With Angela and her minions dead, Sister Gloria, Melissa, Bibi and Johnny leave the house and return to the school where they are greeted by everyone there. But before the film ends, one student is then seen finding the demonic lipstick which turns into a snake and attacks her.

'''''Night of the Demons 3''''' (released as ''Demon House'' in the UK) is the third film in the ''Night of the Demons'' series before the 2009 reboot. It was released in 1997 by Paramount Pictures and Republic Pictures in R-Rated and Unrated versions. It stars Amelia Kinkade, Vlasta Vrána, Gregory Calpakis, Tara Slone, Christian Tessier, Joel Gordon, Larry Day, Kristen Holden-Reid, Stephanie Bauder, and Patricia Rodriguez.
Several years have passed after the massacre for the St. Rita's Academy and on Halloween night, Officer Larry (Larry Day) is on night watch at Hull House, where he is confronted and murdered by Angela (Amelia Kinkade) with his own police badge.
Bad boy Vince (Kristen Holden-Ried), his promiscuous girlfriend Lois (Tara Slone), and their friends Nick (Gregory Calpakis) and Reggie (Joel Gordon) are cruising through town in Vince's sidekick Orson's (Christian Tessier) van. They stop to pick up head cheerleader Holly (Stephanie Bauder) and her shy friend Abbie (Patricia Rodriguez), who broke down on their way to the school dance, on the side of the road. Holly remembers Nick from algebra class on the first day of school, and Nick speculates Holly likes him.
While stopped at a convenience store, Reggie tries to buy beer with his brother's fake ID, but the unfriendly clerk pulls out a shotgun. Tempers escalate, and Vince steals the gun just as two police officers enter the store. One of the officers is accidentally shot when the clerk grabs Vince, and the other shoots Reggie in the stomach twice. A fight between the officer and Vince breaks out, destroying the store. The teenagers and a wounded Reggie pile into the van, Vince brings the shotgun, and Orson steals the police officer's gun, and they drive away. Fortunately, the officer they shot is wearing a bulletproof vest and is not harmed. Lieutenant Dewhurst (Vlasta Vrána), who is due to retire at midnight that night, watches the security camera playback of what happened, and deduces that the clerk's story of a robbery is a cover for stealing the money from the cash register, and that the kids are scared and frightened teens rather than vicious cop killers.
In the van, Vince notices that the gas tank is almost empty, and they decide to hide out at Hull House. Abbie tells Vince that the place is possessed and not to cross over the underground stream, since demons cannot cross over running water, but Vince forces them all to enter at gunpoint. Vince, trying to prove demons do not exist, taunts them and shoots a hole in the wall, causing the evil spirit that possesses the house to rush upstairs from the basement crematorium in the guise of Angela. Orson decides to stand up for himself and reveal that he has the cop's pistol, and tells Vince that he'll watch the others and Angela while Nick, Lois, and Vince make sure Angela is alone in the house.
Angela puts on some music and does an erotic dance to distract Orson, and Abbie and Holly see this as an opportunity to escape with Reggie. Holly tries hot wiring the van, but remembers that Nick is still inside. Angela begins to seduce Orson, simulating fellatio by sucking the bullets out of the gun through the barrel. Then she kisses Orson and her long, demon tongue shoots through the back of his head, killing him. Meanwhile, upstairs, Nick sneaks up on Vince and Lois who are making out, but fails to take the shotgun, and Vince fires the gun at Nick but misses. Outside, Holly hears the shot, and then overhears a voice over Larry's police radio and finds his car. Abbie leaves Reggie in the van to look for Holly, but Angela takes Abbie to a small chapel and plays on her insecurities and says she can make her an irresistible woman, and the demonic Angela kisses her and possesses her as well.
The badly wounded Reggie hears his name called, and leaves the van, only to be run over by the now possessed Orson. Abbie, who has been turned into a demonic version of her cat costume, seduces Vince until he hears the van crash. Lois, who is angry at Abbie because she thinks that she is now the perfect woman to fall in love with Vince, is scratched by Abbie after slapping her, then is pursued by Angela, who causes her hand to transform into a snake head which bites her. Holly smashes the police car window to call the police, but is attacked by Officer Larry. He chases Holly across the courtyard when she steps over the underground stream; Larry tries to step over it and is disintegrated. Nick finds Holly going back into the house to get everyone out. After encountering Orson, they hide in the attic and share a kiss. Orson appears, and Holly throws a can of lye in his face. They rush down to the hall when Dewhurst appears and he explains that he wants to help, then handcuffs them and takes them outside. Vince runs outside using Angela as a hostage. Dewhurst tells Vince that the officer he shot did not die, but Angela convinces Vince that Dewhurst is lying. Vince opens fire, but is shot through the eye and killed, and Angela returns to her demon form. The other demons appear, and Angela offers to let Dewhurst and Nick go free if she will willingly give up her pure and powerful soul. Holly agrees, and Angela turns Vince into a demon. The other demons make their way inside to Hell.
Dewhurst creates a diversion, and stabs Angela with Nick's switchblade. Nick gets in the police car and rams Angela against a tree. As dawn breaks, Angela disappears inside the house. As the three make their way to the gate, Dewhurst tells Nick and Holly that they were not on the security camera at the store and no one will ever know they were there. Angela reappears just as they're about to escape and pulls Dewhurst's heart from his chest. She chases Holly and Nick and just before they cross the underground stream, Angela grabs Holly's arm. Nick ends up pulling Holly and Angela both over the stream and Angela dissolves. Holly leaves a cross made of sticks at the gate and promises she'll be back every Halloween to make sure no one ever goes inside again.  Holly and Nick then walk home and the last screen shot of the house shows the lights turning on and Angela laughing and saying "Happy Halloween".

'''''Night of the Demons''''' is a 2009 American horror film and remake of the 1988 film of the same name. It was directed by Adam Gierasch,
The film opens in 1925, with scenes of gore and demons. Evangeline Broussard prepares to hang herself from her balcony when she is stopped by a man trying to reassure her that he is truly Louis and that she shouldn't hang herself. Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself -- and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs.  Louis stares over the balcony...as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange.
Cut to present day: a girl named Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela.
Police break up the party. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police before leaving. Maddie, Lily, Dex and Jason leave with the rest, leaving an upset Angela alone in the house. After a while, the group returns, unable to find Suzanne, who is revealed to have passed out. Colin returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. The pair find a hidden door, and Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons. Angela surmises that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard.
One of the skeletons bites Angela's hand, which causes her to feel woozy. Colin attempts to leave the house, only to discover that the gate is locked and can't be opened. While everyone plans to wait the night out, Suzanne details how Evangeline supposedly practiced black magic in the hopes that she would attract the attention of Louis, only to have that magic go wrong during a séance. The only person found alive was the maid, who was found scribbling spells on her walls, having been driven insane by the night's events.
Angela slowly succumbs to the skeleton bite -- and turns into a demon. She returns to the group, who partake in a game of spin the bottle. Angela infects Dex by kissing him. Lily angrily leads Dex into a nearby room, where the pair have sex. Dex transforms into a demon and infects Lily. Angela then attempts to seduce the others while Maddie, Jason and Colin leave to find another exit but can't. Angela successfully seduces Suzanne and then rips her breasts and face, turning her into a demon. Jason sees Lily pressing her lipstick into her breast, then voiding it out through her vagina. He warns the others who do not believe him until a demonic Suzanne attacks them. They decide to leave through the house's escape tunnel. On their way, they arm themselves with a gun and a metal bar. They discover the tunnel has caved in before being attacked by Lily and Dex. They manage to fend off the demons but Jason is injured. The survivors run upstairs and tend to Jason's injury. They realize that not only are they in the maid's room but that the symbols remained on the walls. They discover that the demons are attempting to take over seven human hosts to be freed upon the earth, having been thrown out of hell for trying to usurp Satan's rule. The demons had tricked Evangeline into hosting the party so they could take over the guests. The demons can't take over a dead body, which is why Evangeline hung herself. They also find out that the demons don't like rust, finding that they can use it as a weapon.
As the boys fall asleep, Angela taunts Maddie but is unable to enter the room due to the spells. The walls begin pouring with blood, washing off the spells. The trio attempt to re-draw the spells but are lured out of the room when the demons fake daylight in the windows. The demons attack them. Maddie and Colin rush back to the room--and Jason is caught and disemboweled by Angela--turning him into a demon.
As they plan to wait in the room until sunrise, Colin falls through the rotten floorboards, falling many floors into the basement. Maddie climbs down a rope into the basement to help him, but he is now a demon. Maddie manages to get back to the maid's room and fights the demons. She makes her way to the balcony, where she ties a rope around her neck and jumps over, seemingly hanging herself. As the sun rises, the demons are eliminated. Maddie reveals that she only pretended to hang herself, having tied the rope around her waist...and the demons merely assumed that she was dead. Maddie is then able to exit through the gates to her freedom.

'''''Extinction''''' (formerly known as '''''Welcome to Harmony''''') is a 2015 Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Miguel Ángel Vivas who also co-wrote the screenplay with Alberto Marini from the novel ''Y pese a todo'' by Juan de Dios Garduño. The film stars Matthew Fox, Jeffrey Donovan and Quinn McColgan. In a post-apocalypse future, three survivors confront issues from their past, as well as a race of crazed zombies. The film was released on July 31, 2015 in the United States.
After a virus turns people into zombies, a small group of survivors seek refuge in a snow-covered town, believing the virus and all of its monstrous creations had died out. But they only discover the infected had adapted to the environment change, for worse.
The story starts out with survivors on two buses trying to make it to a safe zone. The first bus is attacked by the infected. The people in the second bus, including the main characters (Jack, Patrick, Emma and baby Lu) try to escape. While hiding, Emma is attacked by an infected and bitten.
9 years later, Jack and Patrick are living separately in houses next door, divided by a fence. Emma has died and Lu, now 9, is living with Jack, who she calls father. It is revealed that Patrick is her biological father. She was taken away by Jack because Patrick became an alcoholic and when Emma was attacked and killed, Patrick didn't save her. Now, Patrick and Jack do not talk to each other, and Lu is forbidden to leave the premises. However, she bonds with Patrick's dog between the fence.
A few days later, Patrick and his dog come across a half eaten fox. He follows the trail and sees an infected. He tries to get away but hits a fallen tree. The infected looks down on him but doesn't see him. Instead its ears start moving and it is attracted to gun shots coming from Jack's home. Patrick heads home, firing off shots to warn Jack. However, he attracts the infected and it attacks him. He is bitten on the neck but his dog saves him when Jack hesitates to shoot.
Lu is angry that Jack didn't do anything to help. That night Lu sneaks out of the house to put flowers on the dog's grave. She is attacked by the infected but Jack gets to her in time. He is severely injured by the zombie. Patrick saves Jack and Lu, and ties up the infected. They learn that even though they were technically infected, they are immune to the disease because none of them turned. They also learn that the infected have evolved: they can't see but they have enhanced hearing.
The next day, Lu wants to invite Patrick over for dinner and Jack agrees. Patrick talks on the radio and someone responds, prompting Patrick to want to leave. Jack asks if they can join him and he agrees. They go to the warehouse to pick up supplies and Lu sees a woman in the distance. The guys take her home, realizing she is pregnant. She tells them that her group had heard Patrick on the radio and were on their way. However, their convoy got attacked. At this moment she hears the howling of an infected they had caught. She shoots it with Patrick's gun and tells them the howling is how they call each other. 
They start to board up the house when they hear howling in the distance. Many infected come to the house and start to attack. Fighting ensues; the woman plays music loudly, causing the infected to stop attacking and cover their ears. But the generator starts to run out of gas, causing the music to turn down. Patrick makes a decision to sacrifice himself by luring the infected away from the house. Lighting a flare, he hollers to the infected and they follow. Jack, Lu and the woman drive away as Patrick blows himself and the infected up. Jack, Lu and the woman leave town and watch the sunrise.

The film was first announced on December 20, 2013 as an Ombra Films production, with Jaume Collet-Sera and Miguel Angel Vivas as producers. Filming began in Budapest and the first images were released on February 21, 2014.
''Extinction'' received mixed to negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 25% rating, with an average score of 5.2/10, based on eight critics.
In the New York Daily News review of "Extinction" by Katherine Pushkar entitled "Zombies on Ice" the critic commented on the relationship between Jack and Patrick: "...The movie spends nearly an hour - too long - establishing the bad blood". Considering the zombies, Pushkar noted: "The zombies have evolved. They can now survive cold but they no longer infect people via flesh wounds. Also, they are blind. These are only problems if you're a zombie purist. At least they still want to tear people apart, and they remain plenty scary. If only they had more screen time". Pushkar concluded: "The films core problems: too little zombie and too much plot. The upside though is McColgan as Lu...clearly someone to watch".
Frank Scheck in "The Extinction Review" for The Hollywood Reporter argued: "If there's one reason to hope for an actual zombie apocalypse, it's that there will at least be no more zombie apocalypse movies."
In his "Extinction Review" for Fangoria, Michael Gingold commented: "As movies about flesh-hungry ghouls have overwhelmed the horror scene...it's refreshing when the occasional film puts the people at a premium. Such a movie is Extinction." He added: "...Vivas wrangles the drama into a quietly gripping survival saga, he and his leads fleshing out the trio of protagonists to empathetic effect." He praised "Pedro De Gaspar and Miguel Riesco's detailed production design" and a final act "...packed with exciting, impactful action". He considered that "Extinction...[is] a zombie movie whose creators have recognized that the subgenre's tropes have been played out, and aimed for something a little different."

'''''28 Days Later''''' is a 2002 British apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Danny Boyle, written by Alex Garland, and stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, and Christopher Eccleston. The plot depicts the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors to cope with the destruction of the life they once knew.
Successful both commercially and critically, the film is credited with reinvigorating the zombie genre of horror film. The film spawned a 2007 sequel, ''28 Weeks Later'', a graphic novel titled ''28 Days Later: The Aftermath'', which expands on the timeline of the outbreak, and a 2009 comic book series titled ''28 Days Later''.
In Cambridge, three animal liberation activists break into a medical research laboratory. A scientist in the lab desperately warns them against releasing the captive chimpanzees, which are infected with a highly contagious rage-inducing virus. Ignoring his pleas, the activists release a chimp, which infects a female activist. She then attacks and infects everyone else present.
28 days later, in London, Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma in St Thomas' Hospital. He finds the entire hospital deserted. He wanders the streets of London, finding it deserted as well, with signs of catastrophe everywhere. Jim enters a church and finds a priest, who turns out to be infected. Jim flees, attracting attention of more infected, but Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) rescue him. At one of their safehouses, they explain to Jim that while he was in a coma, a virus spread among the populace, resulting in societal collapse. They claim the virus has been reported in Paris and New York City as well, suggesting the infection has spread worldwide.
The next day, Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house in Deptford, where he discovers they committed suicide in bed together. That night, the three are attacked by more infected. Mark is bitten, and Selena kills him. She curtly explains that the virus spreads through blood and saliva and overwhelms its victims in 10 to 20 seconds. She warns that should Jim become infected, she will kill him "in a heartbeat". The two see some blinking Christmas lights from Balfron Tower and head there. They discover two more survivors - cab driver Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) - who allow them to take shelter. The next day, Frank informs them that their supplies - particularly water - are dwindling. He plays them a pre-recorded radio broadcast from a military blockade near Manchester, claiming they have "the answer to infection" and promises to protect any survivors who reach them.
The group board Frank's cab and head to Manchester, bonding with one another throughout the trip. At the deserted blockade, Frank is infected when a drop of blood falls into his eye. He is killed by the arriving soldiers, who take the remaining survivors to a fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). West reveals to Jim that his "answer to infection" entails waiting for the infected to starve to death and luring female survivors into sexual slavery, to repopulate the world. The group attempts to flee, but Jim is captured and chained next to Sergeant Farrell (Stuart McQuarrie), a dissenting soldier. Farrell shares with Jim his speculation that the virus has not spread beyond Great Britain and that the country is simply being quarantined.
The next day, the soldiers prepare the girls for gang rape, while two soldiers lead Jim and Farrell to execution. When his executioners argue after killing Farrell, Jim escapes and spots a NATO aircraft flying overhead, proving Farrell's theory correct. Jim lures West and another soldier to the blockade, where Jim kills the latter and leaves West stranded for arriving infected. He runs back to the mansion and releases Mailer, an infected soldier West kept for observation. Mailer quickly spreads the infection among the soldiers in the mansion. In the confusion, a soldier drags Selena to the top floor to rape her, but Jim interrupts and kills him by gouging his eyes out. The two reunite with Hannah and run to Frank's cab. Jim is shot by West, who has been waiting inside the cab. Hannah reverses the cab towards Mailer, who grabs West through the rear window and kills him. The trio finally leave the mansion.
Another 28 days later, Jim is recovering at a remote cottage. Downstairs, he finds Selena sewing large swaths of fabric when Hannah appears. The three rush outside and unfurl a huge cloth banner, adding the final letter to the word "HELLO" laid out on the meadow. A lone Finnish jet flies over the landscape, and the infected are shown dying of starvation. The film ends with the jet flying over the three survivors and the pilot calling in a rescue helicopter.
The DVD extras include three alternative endings, all of which conclude with Jim dying. Two were filmed, while the third, a more radical departure, was presented only in storyboards. On 25 July 2003, cinemas started showing the alternative ending after the film's credits.
In this ending, after Jim is shot, Selena and Hannah still rush him to the deserted hospital, but the scene is extended. Selena, with Hannah's assistance, attempts to perform life-saving procedures but cannot revive Jim. Selena is heartbroken and Hannah, distraught, looks to her for guidance. Selena tells Hannah they will go on; they pick up their guns and walk away from Jim's lifeless body. Selena and Hannah, still dressed in ballgowns and fully armed, leave the hospital.
On the DVD commentary, Boyle and Garland explain that this was the original ending of the film's first cut, which was tested with preview audiences. It was rejected for seeming too bleak; the final exit from the hospital was intended to imply Selena and Hannah's survival, whereas test audiences felt the women were marching off to certain death. Boyle and Garland express a preference for this alternative ending, calling it the "true ending". They comment that this ending brought Jim full circle, as he starts and finishes the story in bed in a deserted hospital. This ending was added in the theatrical release of the film beginning on 25 July 2003, placed after the credits and prefaced with the words, "what if..."
=
The "Hospital Dream" ending is an extended version of the theatrical alternative ending, wherein Jim dies at the hospital. It is revealed by the director during the optional commentary that this was the full version of the original ending. Jim dreams while unconscious and remembers the final moments on his bicycle before the crash. The footage cuts back and forth between the scene with Selena and Hannah trying to save his life, and the dream sequence. As he gets hit by a car in his flashback, he simultaneously dies on the operating table.
=
This ending, for which only a rough edit was completed, is an alternative version of the potential rescue sequence shown at the very end of the released film. Here, the scenes are identical, except that this ending was intended to be placed after the first alternative ending wherein Jim dies, so he is absent. When Selena is sewing one of the banner letters in the cottage, she is seen facetiously talking to a chicken instead of Jim. Only Selena and Hannah are seen waving to the jet flying overhead in the final shots.
The "Radical Alternative Ending", rather than a bare ending, is a radically different development of the movie from the midpoint; it was not filmed and is presented on the DVD as a series of illustrated storyboards with voiceovers by Boyle and Garland. When Frank is infected at the military blockade near Manchester, the soldiers do not enter the story. Instead, Jim, Selena, and Hannah are somehow able to restrain Frank, hoping they will find a cure for the virus nearby as suggested in the radio broadcast. They soon discover that the blockade had protected a large medical research complex, the same one featured in the first scene of the film where the virus was developed. Inside, the party is relieved to find a scientist barricaded inside a room with food and water. He will not open the door because he fears they will take his food, although he does admit that the "answer to infection is here". Unfortunately, he refuses to talk further because he does not want to create an emotional attachment to people who will soon be dead. After hours of failed attempts to break through the door or coax the man out, Jim eventually brings Hannah to the door and explains Frank's situation.
The scientist reluctantly tells them Frank can only be cured with a complete blood transfusion and supplies them with the equipment. After learning that he is the only match with Frank's blood type, Jim sacrifices himself so Frank can survive with his daughter. Just as his journey began, Jim is left alone in the abandoned medical facility, and Selena, Hannah and Frank move into the room with the scientist, as a horde of the infected breaches the complex. The computer monitors show death and destruction come to life around a thrashing, infected Jim, who is strapped to the same table as the chimp had been, in the opening scene. Garland and Boyle explain that they conceived this ending to see what the film would be like if they did not expand the focus beyond the four survivors. They decided against it because the idea of a total blood replacement as a cure was not credible. Boyle said in the DVD commentary that it "didn't make much sense", since the film had already established that one drop of blood can infect a person. "What would we do? Drain him of blood and scrub his veins with bleach?"

On the DVD commentary, Boyle explains that, with the aim of preserving the suspension of disbelief, relatively unknown actors were cast in the film. Cillian Murphy had starred primarily in small independent films, while Naomie Harris had acted on British television as a child, and Megan Burns had only one previous film credit. However, Christopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson were well-known character actors.
After director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew Macdonald filmed an adaptation of Alex Garland's novel ''The Beach'', Garland approached Macdonald about his concept for ''28 Days Later.'' In an interview with ''Creative Screenwriting'', Garland explained, "I said to him that I had an idea for a movie about running zombies. I wrote it and sent it to him and the two of us went backwards and forwards with it for a few drafts... At the point I was working on ''28 Days Later'' I had a lot of zombie movies as well as video games like ''Resident Evil'' turning round in my head."
''28 Days Later'' features scenes set in normally bustling parts of London such as Westminster Bridge, Piccadilly Circus, Horse Guards Parade and Oxford Street. To depict these locations as desolate, the film crew closed off sections of street for minutes at a time, usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays and would have typically around 45 minutes after dawn, to shoot the locations devoid of traffic and members of the public - to minimise disruption. Portions of the film were shot on a List of Canon camcorders#Canon XL-1s|Canon XL1 digital video camera. Much of the filming took place prior to the 11 September attacks and in the audio commentary, Boyle notes the parallel between the "missing persons" flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks. Boyle adds that his crew probably would not have been granted permission to close off Whitehall for filming after the terrorist attacks in New York. A clapperboard seen in one of the DVD extra features shows filming was still taking place on 8 October 2001.
The mansion used in the film was Trafalgar Park near Salisbury. Many rooms in the house, including the Cipriani-painted music room and the main hall, were filmed with minimal set decoration. The scenes occurring upstairs were filmed downstairs, as the mansion's owner resided upstairs. This reflects the motorway road signage in the film which indicates the trio heading north towards the Lake District National Park.
On the DVD commentary, Boyle and Garland frequently call it a post apocalypse and horror film, commenting on scenes that were quotation of George A. Romero's Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|Dead trilogy. During the initial marketing of the film Boyle did try to distance the film from such labels. Boyle identified John Wyndham's ''The Day of the Triffids'' as Garland's original inspiration for the story.
''28 Days Later'' was a considerable success at the box office and became highly profitable on a budget of about £5 million. In the UK, it took in £6.1 million, while in the US it became a surprise hit, taking over $45 million despite a limited release at fewer than 1,500 screens across the country. The film garnered around $84.7 million worldwide.
Critical views of the film were very positive. Based on 215 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 87% of critics gave ''28 Days Later'' a positive review.
''Bravo'' awarded it the 100th spot on their list of The 100 Scariest Movie Moments with the commentators explaining that making the zombies move fast for the first time was a bright and effective idea. In 2007, ''Stylus Magazine'' named it the second best zombie movie of all time. The film also ranked at number 456 in ''Empire''

The film's score was composed by John Murphy and was released in a score/song compilation in 2003. It also features notable tracks from Brian Eno, Grandaddy, and Blue States.
A heavily edited version of the song "East Hastings" by the post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor appears in the film, but the track is excluded from the soundtrack, because Boyle could only obtain the rights to use it in the film.
''28 Days Later: The Soundtrack Album'' was released on 17 June 2003. A modified version of the soundtrack "In The House - In A Heartbeat" was used as the character Big Daddy's theme in the 2010 film ''Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass''. The same song was played in the latest advertisement campaign of Louis Vuitton,  L'Invitation au Voyage.
A sequel, ''28 Weeks Later'', was released on 11 May 2007. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland took producing roles alongside Andrew Macdonald. The plot revolves around the arrival of American troops about seven months after the incidents in the original film, attempting to revitalise a nearly desolate Britain. The cast for this sequel includes Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton, and Idris Elba.
In March 2007, Danny Boyle claimed to be interested in making a third film in the series, ''28 Weeks Later#Sequel|28 Months Later''.
Fox Atomic Comics, in association with HarperCollins, released a graphic novel bridging the time gap between ''28 Days Later'' and ''28 Weeks Later'', titled ''28 Days Later: The Aftermath'', written by Steve Niles.
''28 Days Later'', a comic sequel also linking ''Days'' and ''Weeks'' and produced by Fox Atomic (until its demise) and Boom! Studios, began production in 2009. The series focuses on Selena and answers questions about her in the film and her sequel whereabouts.

'''''Death Becomes Her''''' is a 1992 American black comedy fantasy film directed by Robert Zemeckis and scripted by David Koepp and Martin Donovan, starring Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis, Goldie Hawn, and Isabella Rossellini. The film focuses on a pair of rivals who drink a magic potion that promises eternal youth.
''Death Becomes Her'' won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. The film was a commercial success, grossing $149 million at the box office.
In 1978, narcissistic, manipulative Madeline Ashton performs in a campy musical version of ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' on Broadway. She invites long-time rival Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with Helen's fiancé, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Ernest is smitten with Madeline, breaking off his engagement with Helen to marry her. Helen winds up in a psychiatric hospital after fixating upon Madeline. Obese and depressed, Helen feigns rehabilitation and is released, plotting revenge on Madeline.
Seven years later, Madeline lives in Beverly Hills with Ernest, but they are miserable. Madeline's career has faded, and Ernest is an alcoholic reduced to working as a Embalming#Specialist embalming|reconstructive mortician. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives facial treatments. Understanding Madeline's situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle von Rhoman, a woman specializing in youth rejuvenation. 
Madeline and Ernest attend the party for Helen's novel, ''Forever Young'',  and discover Helen is slim, youthful and beautiful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's appearance, Madeline visits her young lover but discovers he is with a woman his age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisle's home. Lisle is a mysterious, wealthy socialite claiming to be 71, but looks much younger. She reveals to Madeline the secret of her beauty: an expensive potion that promises eternal life and an ever-lasting youthful appearance. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated. As a condition of purchase, Madeline must disappear from public life after ten years to keep the existence of the potion secret. Lisle warns Madeline to take good care of her body.
Helen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she and Ernest argue, during which Madeline falls down the stairs, breaking her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. Ernest assumes she has a dislocated neck and drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead and faints. She is taken to the morgue due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80°F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest takes the sign of her "resurrection" as a miracle, returns home with Madeline and uses his skills to repair her body.
Helen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to stage Madeline's death, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her stomach, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need constant maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.
After bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses rather than being immortal. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest refuses and drops the potion to the ground several stories below, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. After Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, the pair realize they must rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.
Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. They are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips and teeters at the top of a staircase. After Madeline hesitates to help her, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads totter together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline, "Do you remember where you parked the car?"

''Death Becomes Her'' was a technically complex movie to make, and the production had a fair number of mishaps.  For example, in a scene where Helen Sharp and Madeline Ashton are battling with shovels, Meryl Streep accidentally cut Goldie Hawn's face, leaving a faint scar. Streep admitted that she disliked working on a project that focused so heavily on special effects, saying:
My first, my last, my only. I think it's tedious. Whatever concentration you can apply to that kind of comedy is just shredded. You stand there like a piece of machinery-they should get machinery to do it. I loved how it turned out. But it's not fun to act to a lampstand. "Pretend this is Goldie, right here! Uh, no, I'm sorry, Bob, she went off the mark by five centimeters, and now her head won't match her neck!" It was like being at the dentist.
Computer generated imagery (CGI) by Industrial Light and Magic was used to create the skin effects, such as Madeline's twisted neck and stretching skin, and the shotgun hole through Helen's abdomen.
 
The score was composed by American film composer Alan Silvestri, who also composed scores of other films directed by Zemeckis.
The film received mixed reviews.  
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film a 'thumbs down', commenting that while the film had great special effects, it lacked any real substance or character depth.
The film's release on DVD was called "appallingly bad", It was later released in North America on Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray from Shout Factory on April 26, 2016.
The film opened at number 1 at the box office with $12,110,355 on the same weekend as and ahead of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Bebe's Kids''. It went on to earn over $149 million worldwide.

'''Ibiza Undead''' is a 2016 horror film written and directed by Andy Edwards. Premiered at London's FrightFest Film Festival in August 2016, the film stars  Cara Theobold, Matt King and Alex Zane. Shot on location in Ibiza and London, it has been described as "The Inbetweeners meets Shaun of the Dead"
A group of young people head to Ibiza for the holiday of a lifetime - only to find a zombie outbreak getting in the way. In the world of Ibiza Undead zombies are commonplace and a new strain of virus has started appearing across the globe, rendering its victims as flesh-eating maniacs. Britain has been severely affected, but zombie are managed and frequent checks ensure that no virus carriers make it across the borders. Club owner Karl Matt King decides that deranged podium dancing zombies are just what he needs for his Ibiza nightclub, so he commissions a boat full of them to be smuggled in. His plan backfires and his 'cargo' ends up in the Mediterranean. But the undead don't stay dead, and when they make their way ashore the holiday paradise of Ibiza soon begins to resemble a war zone. Oblivious to these events, a gang of young men - Jim, Alex and Az  arrive on the island intent on a good time. Other cast members include Inbetweeners star Emily Atack as Alex's older sister and movie pundit Alex Zane who makes a cameo as a club promoter.

Critical reception for ''Ibiza Undead'' has been something of a curate's egg. ''Hollywood News'' felt that the story moved along nicely but had too many characters, including Big Jim who they found 'a little too crass and sex-obsessed to win the audience over'. 'A foul and fun-filled British horror comedy...with a few sick and even sometimes sensitive surprises into the mix of zany teenage clubbing and teens clubbing zombies' Referring to it as a classic 'Zombie comedy|Zom-Com', the Addicted to Horror Movies website describes the film as having 'jokes and spirit in spades' and the potential to stand comparison with the great ''Shaun of the Dead''.

'''''Train to Busan''''' ( The film takes place in a train to Busan, as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks in the country and compromises the safety of the passengers.
The film premiered in the Midnight Screenings section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on 13 May. The film serves as a reunion for Gong Yoo and Jung Yu-mi, who both starred in the 2011 film ''The Crucible''. 
An animated prequel, ''Seoul Station'', also directed by Sang-ho, was released less than a month later.
Seok-woo, a divorced fund manager, is a workaholic and absentee father to his young daughter, Soo-an. For her birthday the next day, she wishes for her father to take her to Busan to see her mother. They board the KTX in Seoul. Others on the same train include tough working-class husband Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, a high school baseball team, rich but selfish CEO Yon-suk, elderly sisters In-gil and Jon-gil, and a homeless man who is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.
As the train departs, a convulsing young woman boards the train with a bite wound on her leg. The woman soon becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who then also turns into a zombie (the bites of the infected are swiftly lethal, and the dead instantly turn even if not bitten). The infection quickly spreads throughout the train. Baseball player Yong-guk, a girl named Jin-hee who has a crush on him, and several passengers manage to escape to another car. News broadcasts report zombie outbreaks throughout the country. The train stops at Daejeon, but the surviving passengers find that the city has also been overrun, and they hastily retreat back to the train, splitting up into different train cars in the chaos. The conductor restarts the train to head to Busan, where a successful quarantine zone has reportedly been established.
Seok-woo, Sang-hwa, and Yong-guk fight their way to where Su-an, In-gil, and Seong-kyeong are hiding, and together they struggle through the zombie horde to the front train car, where the other passengers are sheltered. However, at the instigation of Yon-suk, the passengers block the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa and In-gil sacrifice themselves to give the others time to force open the door and enter the car. Yon-suk demands that the newcomers isolate themselves in the vestibule, and the others follow his lead. When Jong-gil deliberately opens the door to the zombies to be with her zombified sister In-gil, the zombies kill the rest of the passengers, leaving Seok-woo, Soo-an, Yong-guk, Jin-hee, and Seong-kyeong safe, as they are in the vestibule. Yon-suk and the train attendant escape the onslaught by hiding in the bathroom.
A blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. In the process, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, Su-an, and the homeless man are separated from Yong-guk and Jin-hee. Yon-suk escapes after pushing the train attendant to be eaten by the zombies. Entering the train where Yong-guk and Jin-hee are, he slams Jin-hee out of the way in a panic to reach the other door, killing her. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee and is bitten by her when she turns. The train conductor starts a locomotive on another track, but is also killed by zombies while trying to save Yon-suk. The homeless man sacrifices himself to let Su-an and Seong-kyeong escape with Seok-woo into the train the conductor had activated. They encounter Yon-suk in the engine room, on the verge of turning into a zombie. Seok-woo fights him off, but is himself bitten. He puts Soo-an and Seong-kyeong inside the engine room and shares his last words with his daughter before moving outside. As he zombifies, he thinks of the first time he held his daughter in his arms, and throws himself off the locomotive with a smile.
Su-an and Seong-kyeong get off at Busan and begin walking through a train tunnel. On the other side of the tunnel are soldiers stationed to defend the perimeter against zombies. Unable to see the new arrivals clearly, the soldiers at the checkpoint are instructed to shoot them. However, the soldiers then hear singing, which makes them realize the newcomers are human: it is Soo-an, tearfully singing the song that she had wanted to perform for her father at the beginning of the film, now singing it to honor his heroic sacrifice.

'''''Insanitarium ''''' is a 2008 American direct-to-video horror-thriller film starring Jesse Metcalfe, Kiele Sanchez, Kevin Sussman, Olivia Munn, Carla Gallo and Peter Stormare. The film is directed by Jeff Buhler.
The film follows a man, Jack (Jesse Metcalfe), faking insanity in order to save his sister, Lily (Kiele Sanchez), who has been involuntarily institutionalized. The siblings soon find that the strange doctor at the asylum, Mr. Gianetti (Peter Stormare), has been testing an experimental compound, orphium, on the patients that seems to be turning them into flesh-eating zombies; Loomis (Kurt Caceres), another patient, spreads the infection.  The two siblings band together with a terminally paranoid man, Dave (Kevin Sussman), and a helpful nurse, Nancy (Olivia Munn), in the hopes of finding a way out of the asylum.  They are attacked by most of the prisoners and staff, who kill Nancy; while on the 4th floor, they encounter the doctor, who gives Dave an icepick lobotomy, incapacitating him; he attempts to get Jack too, but ends up being infected by Loomis. At the end of the film, as the two siblings are in a police car heading to the asylum to investigate, the officers (Mark Kelly & Sharon Schaffer) accidentally let the patients escape into the outside world. It ends with a panning shot, revealing the city below the asylum's hillside location.
The secondary plot focuses on the affair between Charles (Evan Parke) and Heather (Lisa Athrowe).

The film was shot during August/September 2007 with the majority of filming taking place at the abandoned RFK Memorial Hospital in Hawthorne, California.  The "maximum security" set and the "laundry chute" were both constructed from scratch on site in an empty wing of the hospital.
Mathew Mungle Creations, the same special effects company that supplied the notorious effects for the Jeff Buhler written ''Midnight Meat Train'', also supplied the special effects for Insanitarium.  Nearly everything was done using practical effects and prosthetics with very little contribution from Computer-generated imagery|CGI, including the decapitation of a fake cat.
Stormare improvised many parts of his role, including the "panties in the mouth" scene with Carla Gallo, who plays Vera, his research assistant. She comments on this scene in the behind the scenes DVD extras.

'''''House of the Dead''''' is a 2003 German-Canadian-American zombie film, and the adaptation of the 1996 light gun arcade game of the same name produced by Sega. The film was directed by Uwe Boll and is commonly considered one of the worst films ever made. 
The film was followed by a sequel, ''House of the Dead 2'' (2005).
Two college students, Simon (Tyron Leitso) and Greg (Will Sanderson), take a boat to an island to attend a rave. They meet up with three girls: Alicia (Ona Grauer), Karma (Enuka Okuma) and Cynthia (Sonya Salomaa). Karma has a crush on Simon, Simon has a crush on Alicia, and Cynthia is Greg's girlfriend. When the five arrive at the dock, they find that they are late and the boat that is supposed to take them to the island called "Isla Del Muerte" (Spanish for "Island of the Dead"), has already left. A man named Victor Kirk (Jürgen Prochnow) and his first mate Salish (Clint Howard) offer them a ride. As they leave, a policewoman named Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell) tries to stop them from leaving, knowing of Kirk's past as a smuggler, but fails.
Arriving at Isla Del Monte, they find the rave site messed up and deserted. Alicia, Karma and Simon leave the site to go find anybody around while Cynthia and Greg stay behind. As Greg and Cynthia are about to make out in a tent, the former leaves to urinate. Alone in the tent, Cynthia is killed by a group of zombies. Meanwhile, Alicia, Karma and Simon find an old house and as they attempt to investigate the place, they discover Rudy (Jonathan Cherry), Liberty (Kira Clavell) and Hugh (Michael Eklund), who tell them that zombies attacked the rave, killing everyone. Alicia and Rudy used to date and Liberty was a dancer at the rave. The six leave the house to fetch Greg and Cynthia. Meanwhile, the zombies kill Salish when he is alone in the forest.
Alicia, Rudy, Karma, Simon, Liberty and Hugh return to the rave site and find Greg. A zombified Cynthia comes out from behind a tree and kills Hugh but is killed when Casper arrives and shoots her. They form a plan to return to Kirk's boat and leave the island. When they return to the beach they find only zombies on Kirk's boat. Casper and Greg leave the group to go find help, but Greg is killed in the forest. Kirk later takes the group to a spot in the forest where he has hidden a box full of guns and weaponry. Once everyone is armed, they decide to head back to the house. The front of the house is filled with zombies. Liberty and Casper are killed in the ensuing fight and Alicia, Rudy, Kirk, Karma and Simon manage to take shelter inside the house.
When Kirk is alone, he hears Salish whistling outside of the house. He goes outside and sees Salish as a zombie. Kirk sacrifices himself by killing Salish with a stick of dynamite, but the explosion also blows up the entrance to the house. The remaining four lock themselves in a lab in the house, but the zombies break in. Karma finds a hatch in the floor which she, Alicia and Rudy use to escape. Simon manages to sacrifice himself to kill the zombies by shooting a barrel of gunpowder, blowing up the house and the zombies. Alicia, Rudy and Karma find themselves in underground tunnels. They make their way through the tunnels, but Karma is killed by zombies as she attempts to hold them off as Rudy and Alicia flee.
Alicia and Rudy are aided by a man to get out of the tunnels. The man is actually an evil undead named Castillo Sermano, a Spanish priest from the 15th century who was banished from Spain for his evil experiments which the Catholic Church forbade, one of which was the immortality serum, which he injected himself with before he created the first zombie. Alicia and Rudy escape the tunnels, blowing them up in the process. Castillo manages to survive the blast and Alicia gets into a sword fight with him. Castillo stabs her in the heart wherein Rudy manages to decapitate him. While he thinks that it has all ended, the still-alive headless body of Castillo begins to strangle Rudy. Alicia who is barely alive gets up and crushes the head under her foot which finally kills him. Although Alicia seemingly dies, she and Rudy are rescued by a team of agents. The agents ask for Rudy's last name, to which he responds with The House of the Dead (video game)|"Curien". The ending narration reveals that Rudy gave Alicia the immortality serum and that is why she is alive. The two survivors return home.

'''''A Virgin Among the Living Dead''''' is a 1973 Spanish-French erotic horror film directed by Jesus Franco. It was later recut and redistributed to theaters in 1981 as a zombie film. It has since been restored on DVD to Franco's original director's cut.
Franco shot the film in 1971 in Portugal, Franco himself played a co-starring role in this film as a mindless cretin named Basilio who walks the corridors talking in gibberish to a severed chicken's head.
According to Franco, the original shooting title of the film was ''The Night of the Shooting Stars'' (''La nuit des étoiles filantes''). It was released in France, however, in 1973 as ''Christina, Princess of Eroticism'', and in Italy in 1978 as ''The Erotic Dreams of Christine''; both versions contained new porn inserts featuring Alice Arno added to the film. Franco was not involved in filming the padded sex scenes. 
Producer Marius Lesoeur later had horror director Jean Rollin direct some newly filmed zombie footage that was added to Franco's film for its 1981 re-release, under the new title ''A Virgin Among the Living Dead''. At this time, the English dub was also recorded and the Arno porn footage was taken out. The film was later released on DVD with the 1981 Rollin zombie footage removed, the way Franco originally shot it, but the film's title has always remained ''A Virgin Among the Living Dead'', a title which Franco abhorred.
A woman arrives from England to visit her estranged relatives in a small castle for the reading of her dead father's will. She eventually discovers that they are all undead, and her decision to live with them turns into a nightmare. She learns that the Queen of the Night has claimed her father's eternal soul because he had committed suicide.

The film was first released on VHS in the United States as ''A Virgin Among the Living Dead'' by Wizard Video, with the added Rollin zombie footage included.
The film was released on DVD in the United States by Image Entertainment in 2003 as part of their EuroShock horror line. The DVD also contains the extra Rollin zombie footage from 1981.
On August 20, 2013, a Blu-ray edition, containing both cuts, was made available by Redemption.
Alternative titles include: ''A comme apocalypse''; ''Among the Living Dead''; ''Christina chez les morts vivants''; ''Christina, princesse de l'erotisme''; ''Christina, Sex Princess'';  ''La nuit des etoiles filantes''; ''Los suenos eroticos de Christine''; and ''Zombie 4''
Richard Whittaker of ''The Austin Chronicle'' called it "one of the most infamously mutilated underground favorites", and said the original Franco version is the best cut of the film.

'''''The Oblong Box''''' is a 1969 British horror film directed by Gordon Hessler, starring Vincent Price, Christopher Lee and Alister Williamson. This was the first film to star both Price and Lee.
The film takes place in England in 1865. Having been grotesquely disfigured in an African voodoo ceremony for a transgression against the native populace, Sir Edward Markham (Alister Williamson) is kept locked in his room by his guilt-ridden brother, Julian (Vincent Price). Tiring of his captivity, Sir Edward plots to escape by faking his death. With the help of the crooked family lawyer, Trench (Peter Arne), they hire witchdoctor N'Galo (Harry Baird) to concoct a drug to put Sir Edward into a deathlike trance. Before Trench has time to act, Julian finds his "dead" brother and puts him in a coffin (the title's "oblong box"). Embarrassed by his brother's appearance, Julian asks Trench to find a proxy body for Sir Edward's lying in state. Trench and N'Galo murder landlord Tom Hacket (Maxwell Shaw) and offer his corpse to Julian. After the wake, Trench and his young companion Norton (Carl Rigg), dispose of Hacket's body in a nearby river, while Julian has Sir Edward buried. Now free of his brother, Julian marries his young fiancée, Elizabeth (Hilary Dwyer), while Trench, Norton and N'Galo go their separate ways.
Sir Edward is left buried alive until he is dug up by graverobbers and delivered to Dr. Newhartt (Christopher Lee). Newhartt opens the coffin and is confronted by the resurrected Sir Edward. With his first-hand knowledge of Newhartt's illegal activities, Sir Edward blackmails the doctor into sheltering him. Sir Edward then conceals his face behind a crimson hood and embarks on a vengeful killing spree.
Norton is first on Sir Edward's list and has his throat slit. In between killings, Sir Edward finds time to romance Newhartt's maid Sally (Sally Geeson), but when Newhartt finds out about their affair, he discharges Sally and she goes to work for Julian. While searching for Trench, he is sidetracked by a couple of drunks who drag him into a nearby tavern. Here he ends up with prostitute Heidi (Uta Levka), who tries to roll him for his money, only to be killed by Sir Edward's knife. The police get involved, and the hunt is on for a killer in a crimson hood.
Meanwhile, Julian has become suspicious about the body which Trench supplied to him, after his friend Kemp (Rupert Davies) finds it washed up on a riverbank. Julian confronts Trench, who tells him the truth about Sir Edward's "death". Soon after, Trench is dispatched by Sir Edward, but not before he tells him the whereabouts of N'Galo. Hoping he will cure him of his disfigurement, Sir Edward asks N'Galo for his help. Here Sir Edward learns the truth about his time in Africa: in a case of mistaken identity he was punished for his brother's crime of killing an African child. N'Galo fails to cure Sir Edward, and they fight; N'Galo stabs Sir Edward and is rewarded with a face full of hot tar. Sir Edward returns to Newhartt's home, where Newhartt tends to his wound. Mistrusting Newhartt's medical treatment, Sir Edward fatally wounds him and sets off to confront his brother.
Back at the Markham ancestral home, Julian learns the whereabouts of his brother from Sally and leaves for Dr. Newhartt's home, only to find him near death. Meanwhile, Sir Edward arrives back home to find Sally, who is repulsed by her former lover's killing. Sir Edward drags her out onto the grounds of the house, pleading for her love. Julian arrives back home and gives chase with a shotgun. Out on the grounds, Sally snatches Sir Edward's hood from him and his deformed face is revealed for the first time. Julian catches up and Sir Edward confronts him about his crime. As Sir Edward lurches forward, Julian shoots him. Cradling the dying Sir Edward in his arms, Julian is bitten by him.
Once again in his "oblong box", Sir Edward is resurrected by a vengeful N'Galo, but this time he is six feet under with no hope of escape. While back at the Markham mansion, Julian is occupying his brother's old room, where he is beginning to show the first signs of the voodoo curse. His wife Elizabeth learns this when she tells him about his brother's room: Julian then says, "It is now my room". She is flushed with fear of his disfigurment and the film (with credits) closes with a close up of her widened eyes.

Price, Davies and Dwyer had recently appeared in ''Witchfinder General'', under the direction of Michael Reeves, and on 18 November 1968, the four also began work on the ''Oblong Box''. The original script had the Markham brothers as twins, both played by Vincent Price. However, Reeves died during pre-production, so Hessler stepped in and made a number of substantial changes. Another man who got called in was Christopher Wicking: he was called in after the sudden death of writer Lawrence Huntington as shooting began.
With the help of Christopher Wicking, he reworked the screenplay to incorporate the theme of imperial exploitation of native peoples in Africa. This theme gave the film a "pro-black" appearance that would later cause it to be banned in Texas.
The leading role of the film was given to character actor Alister Williamson, his first. Although he has the largest amount of screen time, more than either Price or Lee, his real voice is never heard (it was redubbed by another actor) and his face is covered for the majority of the film. His makeup was done by Jimmy Evans, whose other credits include ''Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter'' (1972) and Hessler's ''Scream and Scream Again'' (1970).
Hessler says AIP insisted he use Hilary Dwyer.:
I don't know what the situation was, but they liked her and they kept pushing you to use certain actors. I guess the management must have thought she was star material or something like that.
According to Hessler, the film was very successful and ushered in a series of follow up horror movies for AIP including ''Scream and Scream Again'' and ''Cry of the Banshee''.
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 57% of seven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.6/10.

'''''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''''' is a 2004 science fiction action horror film directed by Alexander Witt and written by Paul W. S. Anderson. It is the second installment in the Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series, which is based on the Capcom survival horror video game series ''Resident Evil''.
Borrowing elements from the video games ''Resident Evil 2'', ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis|3: Nemesis'', and ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica'', ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' follows heroine Alice, who has escaped the underground Umbrella facility and must band with other survivors including Jill Valentine and escape Raccoon City alive.
The film opened to theaters on September 10, 2004. On a budget of $40 million, the film grossed $51 million domestically and $129 million worldwide, surpassing the box office gross of the previous installment. ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' received mostly negative reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences but criticized the plot. The film was released to DVD on December 28, 2004.
After the contamination of The Hive in the previous film, the Umbrella Corporation unwisely sends in a research team to reopen the complex and investigate the incident, since no one survived except Alice and Matt Addison, both of whom were imprisoned. When the team reprograms and opens the sealed blast doors, they are slaughtered by the massive crowd of T-virus infected zombies.
With the zombies released, they reach Raccoon City, spreading the infection among the general population. Two days after the infection has spread to the surface, Umbrella, now worried about a possible worldwide contamination, quarantines Raccoon City and establishes a security perimeter around it, also evacuating all important Umbrella personnel. However, a girl named Angela Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur), daughter of the Level 6 Umbrella researcher and T-virus creator Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), goes missing after an Umbrella security car transporting her out of Raccoon City suffers a traffic accident.
Alice awakens in the deserted Raccoon City hospital attached to wiring, and after unstrapping herself, she manages to exit her room. Finding no one in the hospital, she wanders outside only to find the city a ghost town, overrun by zombies. She arms herself with a shotgun from a police car and wanders the city looking for supplies. She is constantly disturbed by visions of a man, who was revealed to be experimenting on her; she now has superhuman agility and strength.
While Umbrella is evacuating civilians at the Raven's Gate Bridge, the only exit out of the town, disgraced police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), confers with Sergeant Payton Wells (Razaaq Adoti), her old ally, after hearing about the infection being true. However, the T-virus infects a man having a heart attack, turning him into a zombie that bites Payton at the city gates. Umbrella's supervisor and the head of the Raccoon City contamination operation, Major Timothy Cain (Thomas Kretschmann), worried that the T-virus has reached the gates, seals the exit and orders his soldiers to fire over the crowd's heads, scaring them back into the city.
Elsewhere, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and other Umbrella soldiers link up with Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) units to defend against an onslaught of zombies. Their positions are overrun, causing Carlos and his team to retreat with a bitten Yuri (Stefen Hayes), who turns into a zombie and infects Carlos before being killed. Jill, Payton, and news reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) lock themselves in a church, where a panicked man is also hiding. Inspecting the church, Jill finds a priest who has been feeding other people to his zombified sister. They soon find the church is full of Lickers. The priest and the panicked man are killed, but Jill, Payton, and Terri are saved at the last minute by the heavily-armed Alice.
In the meantime, Umbrella dispatches their Nemesis Program to fight the zombies in order to test him. When Nemesis encounters a surviving citizen, L.J. (Mike Epps), and members of S.T.A.R.S., the latter open fire on Nemesis. Nemesis guns the team down but spares L.J.'s life when he drops his weapons. Meanwhile, Dr. Ashford has refused extraction, since Angela is missing, and soon discovers she is hiding in her school. He hacks into the city's CCTV system, uses it to contact Alice and the other survivors, and offers to arrange their evacuation in exchange for their rescuing Angela. Alice, seeing no other escape, accepts the offer. Payton, Terri, and Jill initially refuse, intending to hide until backup arrives, but Alice explains her choice - as the contamination cannot be controlled, a nuclear bomb will be dropped on Raccoon City, completely destroying it, with a cover story of a meltdown of the local nuclear power plant.
Seeing no choice, the others join Alice in heading for the school. However, Nemesis appears and shoots Payton dead. Alice separates and assaults him, but she is overwhelmed and forced into retreat. Jill and Terri make it to the school, and they pick up L.J. on the way. Inside the school, they find Carlos and Nicholai (Zack Ward), acting on the same offer. After encounters with List of Resident Evil creatures#Cerberus or Zombie Dog|zombie dogs and infected children who kill Nicholai and Terri, Alice saves the group again, and they find Angela. Angela reveals she was injected with the T-virus; she was ill with a genetic disease and forced to walk on crutches. Dr. Ashford created the T-virus to allow her to walk, and he created the anti-virus because of the T-virus' potential for mutations, but the virus was then impounded and weaponized by Umbrella. Alice uses Terri's video camera to record her story and injects Carlos with the anti-virus carried by Angela, to keep her infection in check.
Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of the extraction point at City Hall, where the helicopter waits. The group makes it to the rendezvous but is cornered by Major Cain, who has caught wind of Dr. Ashford's intentions and is holding him prisoner. All but Alice are restrained, and seconds later Nemesis appears; the helicopter is actually Nemesis' extraction before the bomb detonation. Cain commands Alice to fight Nemesis. Alice refuses, but when Cain shoots Dr. Ashford dead in cold-blood and threatens the others, she relents and fights Nemesis, impaling him on a pole. Defeating Nemesis, she realizes he is Matt Addison, her friend and one of the survivors in The Hive. As he was infected by a Licker and started to mutate, he was placed in the program and experimented on.
Her stand and refusing to kill him rekindles a trace of Matt's former humanity; he and Alice join forces and attack the Umbrella forces. Meanwhile, Carlos and Jill cut themselves free from their bonds and join the fight. Nemesis is killed, protecting Alice from an exploding helicopter. Cain, having been knocked out in an attempt to flee during the fight, is thrown out of the helicopter by Alice and is left to be devoured by a horde of encroaching zombies, including Dr. Ashford. As the survivors escape in the remaining chopper, the nuclear missile detonates over the City Hall. The helicopter is caught in the blast wave and crashes. As the helicopter falls, a metal pole comes loose and is flung towards Angela. Alice moves in front of Angela and is impaled, saving her but mortally wounding herself.
Some hours after the explosion, Umbrella employees locate the helicopter's crash site, deep in the Arklay Mountains. There, they find Alice's body, badly burned; the others are nowhere to be found. The media later shows that Terri's footage has been shown to the press, but despite Carlos and Jill's best efforts, Umbrella promotes a fake story about a nuclear power plant explosion near the city with ease. The infection is characterized as a hoax, and the media announces that Jill and Carlos are wanted by the police for questioning.
Three weeks later, in Umbrella's research facility in Detroit, Alice awakens. Led by Umbrella scientist Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), the doctors begin questioning her. Soon, she recalls events from Raccoon City and before. She realizes that the man who appeared in her visions is Dr. Isaacs. She attacks him, fights her way out of the facility, and makes her way outside, only to be surrounded by more Umbrella guards holding her at gunpoint. Suddenly, Jill, Carlos, Angela, and L.J. arrive, disguised as Umbrella employees. Carlos shows the guards an order placing her in his custody. Dr. Isaacs is shown allowing them to leave, and then saying that "Project Alice" is activated. A close-up of Alice's eye shows a flashing Umbrella logo, revealing she is under their control. The scene then pulls away from the car she is in and into orbit, where an Umbrella satellite is seen.

Eric Mabius appears as the character of Matt Addison in stock footage from the previous film. Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody has a cameo as a zombie.
''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' was first discussed by Milla Jovovich and Paul W. S. Anderson while promoting ''Resident Evil'' (2002). Anderson stated that he began writing the screenplay for the second film after completing the first. He revealed an idea to have Jill Valentine meeting up with Alice, The sequel was officially Green-light|greenlit by Sony in mid-2002, however Anderson chose not to direct but rather stay on as the film's producer and writer due to commitments to ''Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator'' (2004).
Alexander Witt was hired by Sony to direct the sequel. Milla Jovovich confirmed her character would return in the sequel if the first film was successful, and when the film was greenlit, Jovovich officially signed on.
In March 2002, Eric Mabius (who played Characters in the Resident Evil films#Matt Addison|Matt Addison in the first film), confirmed the story would revolve around his character becoming Nemesis. He also revealed he would portray the character and study his movements whilst playing ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', however before production began he pulled out however passed on the role and the character's name was changed to List of Resident Evil characters#William Birkin|Dr. Isaacs, with Iain Glen being cast in the role.
Jack Noseworthy was originally rumored to portray List of Resident Evil characters#Brad Vickers|Brad Vickers, however, this was later revealed as a rumor.
In March 2002, it was revealed that the film borrowed plot elements from ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', as the film's subtitle was revealed as ''Resident Evil: Nemesis''. It was also revealed that the film included new characters from the video game series, such as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, Carlos Olivera, Dr. William Birkin and Nemesis.
The film borrowed numerous elements from the game series, including re-enactments of certain scenes, such as Alice running through a building with an Umbrella helicopter firing at her, up to the point where she drops her gun, falls, re-grabs it and fires, which is reminiscent of the introductory cutscene of ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica''. Another scene where Raccoon City is overrun by zombies and the police and Umbrella mercenaries are fighting back is reminiscent of the introduction of ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.'' Other scenes involve the launching a missile to destroy Raccoon City and the attack at the graveyard.
The film references ''Resident Evil'', with the crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the ''Resident Evil'' series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue can be seen in the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the ''Resident Evil'' series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.
The film references ''Resident Evil 2'' when Alice visits the gun shop which is similar to Kendo's Gun Shop. Angela Ashford's character is based on List of Resident Evil characters#Sherry Birkin|Sherry Birkin, as they are both children, dressed in school uniforms, and in need of rescue. Both of their fathers are also researchers working for Umbrella. The Ashford name comes from the founders of Umbrella revealed in ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica''. The film also references ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'' with Jill wearing the same outfit. Nemesis is a character taken directly from the game, and the "STARS"  are mentioned on numerous occasions.
Actors portraying zombies were trained at a zombie "boot camp" where they were coached to act as "zen" zombies and "liquid" zombies. Anderson and other crew members intended to make the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking a fundamental element of the games. The design for Nemesis was to include an actor in a suit (Matthew G. Taylor) with only special effects applied to certain parts of the character's body, such as the eye. The List of Resident Evil creatures#Licker|Lickers were fully computer-generated, though the use of physical puppets was originally considered. To avert issues faced during production, the CGI work of the Lickers began early. The film was filmed on location in Canada, with the film entering pre-production stages in mid-2003. Principal photography was slated to originally begin in July 2003, before being bumped up to August 6, 2003.
The film was shot in Ontario, Canada, with Toronto and its surrounding suburbs being a stand-in for Raccoon City.DAVE KEHR, "," ''The New York Times'' (September 10, 2004). It was originally feared that production would be shut down due to the Severe acute respiratory syndrome#Canada|2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto.
The film was planned for an October 31, 2003 release,
The theatrical trailer was released on Yahoo! Movies on July 7, 2004
A novelization written by Keith R. A. DeCandido was published by Pocket Star on August 31, 2004.  The novel is 288 pages long. DeCandido also wrote the novelizations for the first and Resident Evil: Extinction|third films.
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 21% based on 124 reviews., Flixster The site's Critics Consensus reads, "Resident Evil: Apocalypse has lots of action, but not much in terms of plot or creativity."
Metacritic gives the film a score of 35/100 based on 26 reviews., Metacritic CBS
Leonard Maltin rated the film a "BOMB" in his book ''Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide'', and called it a "Tiresome follow-up to ''Resident Evil'' that plays more like a remake." Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave the film a score of half a star out of four, saying: "The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There was no reason to produce it, except to make money, and there is no reason to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say they liked this movie, do not let them date your children.", Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, September 10, 2004
Dave Kehr of ''The New York Times'' gave the film a positive review, saying: "Anderson's screenplay provides a steady series of inventive action situations, and the director, Alexander Witt, makes the most of them. His work is fast, funny, smart and highly satisfying in terms of visceral impact.", Dave Kehr, The New York Times M. E. Russell of ''The Oregonian'' said: "The bad news? The movie is monumentally stupid. The good news? It's a fun kind of stupid."Review by M. E. Russell, Portland Oregonian, September 2004
Nathan Rabin of ''The A.V. Club|A.V. Club'' said that the film "takes too long to get going to qualify unequivocally as a good movie, but when Jovovich finally starts kicking zombified ass, it becomes good enough."
Gregory Kirschling of ''Entertainment Weekly'' praised Jovovich but felt that "the rest of the cast is strictly direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD.", Gregory Kirschling, Entertainment Weekly Ben Kenigsberg of ''The Village Voice'' said the film is "not without its moments of elemental dread [but] also obviously padded, too long on action, and painfully short on irony. The satirical element still packs a minor jolt.", Ben Kenigsberg, Village Voice Carrie Rickey of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' said that "those who want something more substantial from a movie than a vid-game script with centerfold appeal will not find it in this noisy, bone-crushing survivalist flick." 
In 2009, ''Time'' listed the film on their list of top ten worst video game movies. According to the DVD extras of ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' (2007), Paul W. S. Anderson, the director of the first film and writer of the series, was critical of director Alexander Witt's work.

'''''Resident Evil: Extinction''''' is a 2007 science fiction action horror film and the third installment in the Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series based on the Capcom survival horror video game series ''Resident Evil''. The film follows the heroine Alice, along with a group of survivors from Raccoon City, as they attempt to travel across the Mojave desert wilderness to Alaska and escape a zombie apocalypse. The film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and produced by Paul W. S. Anderson.
The film received mostly negative reviews. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray in North America on January 1, 2008.
This film was initially titled ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' according to the leaked script. For unknown reasons, it was renamed to ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. The title ''Afterlife'' was used for the Resident Evil: Afterlife|fourth installment of the series.
Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up disoriented in a mansion. She wanders through the halls, where she defeats several obstacles, including a deadly laser beam obstacle and a giant blade that falls from the ceiling. However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice clones and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms out to show a shack camouflaging the facility's above-ground entrance - with the rest of the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.
Despite the best efforts of the bio-tech company Umbrella Corporation to cover up the contamination of The Hive and the release of the T-virus to the surface, going so far as to authorize the Resident Evil: Apocalypse|bombing of Raccoon City, the T-virus has spread around the world. As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She responds to a group asking for help on the radio. It turns out that they are bandits who first attempt to rape her and then have her killed by infected dogs, only for her to unleash them unto her captors. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.
Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), former head of Project Alice and the head of the North American Umbrella facility, operated in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the world-wide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.
Meanwhile, a convoy of survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) travels across the country in search of supplies. The convoy includes Raccoon City survivors List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), along with new survivors List of Resident Evil film characters#K-Mart|K-Mart (Spencer Locke), Mikey (Christopher Egan), Chase (Linden Ashby), Otto (Joe Hursley) and Nurse Betty (Ashanti Douglas) and others.
While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is bitten by a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is attacked by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her a diary she found, while she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska. They agree to go to Las Vegas-Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas to search for gasoline and supplies for their trip to Alaska.
Dr. Isaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed that remembers basic things, such as how to use phones and cameras. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater (Matthew Marsden), is adamant about Isaacs' disregard for Umbrella's regulations. Slater does admit that the "super zombies" would be useful, but reiterates that Isaacs is out of control. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch on Isaacs' actions, and tells Slater that if Issacs disobeys orders, Slater should kill Isaacs.
Umbrella triangulates Alice's location based on the signal sent out by her telekinetic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Wesker's specific orders. L.J. succumbs to his infection and bites Carlos. Most of the convoy, including Mikey and Chase, are killed in the ambush. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he becomes infected as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground location.
The convoy heads over to the site, which is surrounded by thousands of zombies around the area. Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing them all up, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives with a group of commandos and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection. Explaining that the zombies are enhanced and, as such, he requires a bigger dosage of the anti-virus, he disobeys Slater's command to stop since it will only increase his mutation. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering his mutation into a monstrous Tyrant. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.
Entering the facility, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queen's sister AI, the White Queen (Madeline Carroll). The White Queen informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-virus, defending the Red Queen's actions as well. She then tells Alice about Dr. Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from shock upon seeing Alice. Alice finds a replica of the mansion she lived in and finds Isaacs, who fights her with equal strength and telekinesis. Finding themselves in a replica of The Hive's laser corridor, Alice awaits for the grid's arrival, watching Isaacs getting sliced into cubes. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, which has inexplicably revived.
Later, in Tokyo, Japan, Wesker, who is the head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility, informs the rest of the Umbrella chairmen, all holograms, that the North American facility has been lost. Alice's hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him, and she's bringing some of her "friends." Standing beside her clone, Alice looks out onto a huge number of pods containing her developing clones.

''Resident Evil: Extinction'' was first discussed by ''Resident Evil'' franchise writer Paul W. S. Anderson after ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' opened at number 1 on the US box office in 2004, earning more than United States dollar|$23.7 million dollars on its opening weekend.
On November 7, 2005, Davis Film, Constantin Film and Screen Gems announced their distribution rights worldwide with the film's title being changed from ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' to ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. Impressed with Russell Mulcahy's work on ''Highlander'', ''Highlander II: The Quickening'', ''The Shadow'' and ''Ricochet'', Anderson signed Mulcahy on as director, stating, "Russell pioneered a very distinct visual style, a lot of moving camera and crane work, lots of very fast cutting. He's got a very cool eye and sees great ways to shoot. His work certainly had a big influence on me as a filmmaker and that's why I was very excited to work with him on this movie."
 portrayed Claire Redfield, a character that originated from the video game series.
On June 12, 2005, Milla Jovovich was announced to reprise her role as the heroine Alice. In an interview with BlackFilm.com on September 9, 2005, Mike Epps confirmed that he would be reprising his role from ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' as L.J. Wayne, noting that "Black people die in these movies and [Anderson] was like, 'Well Mike, I kinda like you.' So then I asked him, 'Are you setting me up to die because if there's a fourth movie, I'm as good as dead.'"
Chris Redfield was rumored to appear in the film portrayed by Australian actor Charlie Clausen and Leon S. Kennedy was also rumored to be played by Jensen Ackles.
The film's story takes place in Death Valley, where the large scale action sequences take place amid post-apocalyptic landscapes of Las Vegas in broad daylight. Drawing inspirations from western films and Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic movies, including the Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' series, ''Extinction'' manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around the shortage of oil, the shortage of supplies, a convoy traveling across a desert, and the desert taking over civilized land.
Anderson stated that the film's story is original and unfolds in a world that fans of the game recognize: "It's all part of trying to deliver a movie-going experience that satisfies the fans of the game but also provides a fun cinematic experience for a broader audience that has never played a ''Resident Evil'' game." The story takes place five years after the events of ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. While previous installments in the series had minor changes to plot and characters, ''Extinction'' branches completely away from the video game series as evidenced by the fact that ''Resident Evil 4'' takes place six years after the events portrayed in ''Resident Evil 2'' and the world has not become overrun with zombies. References to ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code Veronica'' are made, such as the replica mansion and the viral outbreak itself. A common element used throughout each ''Resident Evil'' film is the climactic battle which occurs in the finale. ''Extinction'' marked the first appearance of herbs, a healing item in the video game series, as seen in Dr. Isaac's lab, and it also referenced the first film with the inclusion of a replica Hive facility designed after the one in Raccoon City, the Raccoon City Hospital, a holographic computer database known as the White Queen, and the replica Spencer Mansion.
Numerous references to the video game series have been made, including zombies being unleashed through a T-virus mutation. While the concept of the undead remains the same, this film includes "Super Undead". As Anderson explains, these are "a result of Umbrella experimenting with the Undead and attempting to give them back some of their reasoning power, some of their intelligence and a little of their humanity. Unfortunately, these experiments don't quite work and the side effect is the Super Undead, which are Undead that are faster, stronger and [a] more cunning foe." Other creatures from the video game series have also made appearances in the film, including the Tyrant, a swarm of crows, and a pack of Dobermans (although Belgian Shepherd Dogs were used during production).
Two main characters were added to the film's cast: the main antagonist Albert Wesker (portrayed by Jason O'Mara) and secondary protagonist Claire Redfield (portrayed by Ali Larter) from ''Resident Evil 2''.
Horror magazine ''Fangoria'' featured the film in its August 2007 issue and also on the cover of its September 2007 issue, talking with director Russell Mulcahy. The following details reported were inaccurate, possibly indicating to a change in the storyline:
* Alice's convoy are traveling across the Nevada desert trying to reach sanctuary in Alaska to meet Chris Redfield and other survivors. In the film, however, there is no mention of Chris, and the convoy is headed by Claire.
* The film would feature new "super zombies" that had been "pumped up on some sort of alter-essence steroids". The final "super zombies" are created using blood taken from clones of Alice.
* Mulcahy stated concerning the (what was then considered to be) ending of the film trilogy, "As far as I'm aware, this is indeed supposed to close the book."
* ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' takes place eight years after ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. In the film, this was contradicted when characters stated that it had been five years since the outbreak.
* The character of Claire Redfield did not exist in the early draft scripts for the film and previously Jill Valentine (who appeared in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' played by Sienna Guillory) would continue the role in ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. Later, producers Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt decided to have a separate game character appear alongside Alice, saying, "We thought, rather than bring Jill back, put her with another game heroine."
''Resident Evil: Extinction'' began principal photography in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico and with the film's special effects being covered by Tatopoulos Studios and Mr. X Inc., whom both worked on the 2006 film ''Silent Hill''.
In late June 2006, Sony released the film's first two production stills which included Alice wearing a costume designed by her fashion company Jovovich-Hawk and Claire Redfield.
The film's teaser trailer was shown with ''Ghost Rider'' on February 16, 2007, and was structured in the same manner of the "Regenerate" teaser trailer for ''Apocalypse''. The film's website was launched by Sony on February 17, 2007 with confirmation of its September 21, 2007 release date.
The film's teaser poster was leaked onto the internet via a fansite in May 2007, and on September 17, 2007 the Discography of the Resident Evil film series#Resident Evil: Extinction|film's soundtrack was released, whereas the Discography of the Resident Evil film series#Resident Evil: Extinction (Score)|film's score was released on December 18, 2007.
On July 31, 2007, a full two months before the film's release, a novelization by Keith R. A. DeCandido was published. At 368 pages, it is the longest of all of the ''Resident Evil'' novels. DeCandido also wrote the novelizations of the first (subtitled as ''Genesis'') and Resident Evil: Apocalypse|second films.
''Resident Evil: Extinction'' was released on DVD, UMD, and high-definition Blu-ray Disc in North America on January 1, 2008. A Blu-ray release of the ''Resident Evil'' trilogy, featuring the three films in one package was also released on January 1. A 3-disc DVD set of the ''Resident Evil'' trilogy was also made available in 2008.
The film was the number one movie at the North American box office on its opening weekend, grossing $23 million in 2,828 theaters, averaging $8,372 per theater. As of January 1, 2008, the film had grossed $50,648,679 domestically and $97 million overseas for a worldwide total of $147 million.
''Extinction'' was negatively received by critics upon release. The film received a Rotten Tomatoes score of 22% based on 94 reviews
Steven Hyden of ''The Onion'''s The A.V. Club|A.V. Club said that "the movie delivers some simple-minded thrills" and praised the "solidly effective killer-ravens sequence" but felt the film was too predictable, saying: "Anybody who has ever seen a zombie movie can figure out what happens next. Somebody will get bit without telling the others, which will inevitably backfire. Survivors will be forced to shoot suddenly undead friends in the head. One of them dastardly science folk will protect the monsters in order to study them, which will also inevitably backfire. And legions of undead will be re-killed in surprisingly easy fashion."
Kevin Crust of the The Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times'' praised the film, saying that "the story and characters are surprisingly engaging, with fight scenes and scares effectively placed between plot turns" although he felt that the ending was too "open-ended".''Resident Evil'': Extinction'' Review|http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/24/entertainment/et-resident24
Kyle Smith of the ''New York Post'' gave ''Extinction'' half a star out of a possible four, saying that the film was "no more interesting than watching someone else play with his Playstation".
Scott Brown of ''Entertainment Weekly'' said that ''Extinction'' "plays like a flabby middle chapter, full of nerdy details but fraudulently short on the ruined Vegas-scape that ads have been promising." Jack Mathews of the ''New York Daily News'' gave the film a score of one and a half stars out of five, calling the action scenes "monotonous" and urging audiences to "flee this yawn of the dead.", Jack Mathews, New York Daily News
Helen O'Hara of ''Empire'' gave ''Extinction'' a score of 4 out of five, saying that the film was "better than ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''" and had "an effectively creepy empty world setting".", Helen O'Hara, Empire
Frank Scheck says that as the film is "fast-paced and filled with brisk action sequences", it should "reasonably satisify the devotees."''Resident Evil: Extinction'' Review|http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/resident-evil-extinction-158006 Maitland McDonagh of ''TV Guide'' gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying: "Equal parts ''Mad Max'' and ''Day of the Dead'', [''Extinction''] is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip.", Maitland McDonagh, TV Guide Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave ''Extinction'' a score of three out of five, saying that the film had "rather lazy pacing" but added that "the way Anderson keeps upping the ante with regard to Alice's ultimate fate continues to amuse.", Pete Vonder Haar, Film Threat, September 23, 2007
A common complaint was the noticeable digital airbrushing on numerous close-up shots of Jovovich's face, for which reviewers were confused at the use of, or found unnecessary.

'''''Resident Evil''''' is a 2002 German-British science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and produced by Bernd Eichinger. The film stars Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  It is the first installment in the Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series, which is loosely based on the Capcom survival horror video game series ''Resident Evil''. Alongside Jovovich and Rodriguez, it also stars Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon. It is produced by Bernd Eichinger and by Anderson himself.
Borrowing elements from the video games ''Resident Evil'' and ''Resident Evil 2'', the film follows amnesiac heroine Alice and a band of Umbrella Corporation commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-virus at a secret underground facility. The film received mixed reviews from critics but some highly praised Jovovich and the cast performances as well as the action sequences and the zombies design, and was a box office success, grossing more than $102 million worldwide.
Underneath Raccoon City exists a genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's artificial intelligence, the Red Queen, seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.
Alice awakens  naked in the bathroom of a deserted mansion with amnesia. She dresses, checks the mansion, and is subdued by an unknown person. A group of Sanitation Team commandos led by James Shade breaks into the mansion and arrests Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. The group travels to the underground train under the mansion that leads to the Hive, where they find Spence. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence are security guards for a Hive entrance under the disguise of a couple living in the mansion. Five hours prior, the Red Queen had shut down the entire facility and released a gas which killed everyone inside, flooded the labs, and destroyed the elevators, also causing Spence and Alice's amnesia.
At the Queen's chamber, a laser defense system  kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's urgent pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables the Red Queen systems, and the power fails, opening all of the doors in the Hive. This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing Lickers. When everyone regroups, they are ambushed by a horde of zombies and a gunfight ensues. J.D. perishes as the group becomes overwhelmed. A bitten Rain retreats with Kaplan and Spence; Matt becomes separated from Alice, who starts regaining her memories. 
Matt looks for information about his sister Lisa and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.
Alice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.
On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding on the train and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a trapdoor button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open and a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the Resident Evil: Apocalypse|Nemesis Program.
Some time later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table, with no memory of what happened since her capture. After escaping, she goes outside to find Raccoon City abandoned and ruined. Alice arms herself with a shotgun from an abandoned police car as the camera pans out.

In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a ''Resident Evil'' film with George A. Romero signed on as the Film director|film's director and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the ''Resident Evil'' video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for ''Biohazard 2'' (''Resident Evil 2'') in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studio's Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource.  Romero's screenplay was based on the first ''Resident Evil'' game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear.  The ending to the film would have been similar to that of the ''best'' ending to the first ''Resident Evil'' game. As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.
Hired by Sony, Paul W. S. Anderson wrote a screenplay, which was ultimately favored over Romero's. In late 2000, Anderson was announced as director and writer, and ''Resident Evil'' re-entered pre-production stages.
In early 2001, Michelle Rodriguez,
In early March 2001, it was announced that half of the film would be shot in Adlershof Studios in Berlin and its surroundings.
The Film score|film's score and Discography of the Resident Evil film series#Resident Evil: Music from and Inspired by the Original Motion Picture|soundtrack were composed by Clint Mansell,
The film was originally subtitled as "''Resident Evil: Ground Zero''" when the movie was considered a prequel to the games, however the subtitle was removed due to the September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks. The film's first plot as of March 16, 2001 revealed that Jovovich's Alice and Rodriguez's Rain were the leaders of a commando team sent in to prevent a viral outbreak from spreading to the rest of the world. The character of the Red Queen was added into the film's story as an homage to HAL 9000 from ''2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey''.
During production, professional dancers were hired to star as zombies as they had better control of their body movements.  While computer effects were used on some zombies, much of the undead appearances were accomplished through make-up while their movements were a more laissez-faire approach, as Anderson told the actors to move however they thought a zombie would, given their conditions.  Whilst filming, there was a shortage of manpower where the available dancers were not enough to represent the required numbers of undead, however some of Capcom's executives and several of the film producers including Jeremy Bolt agreed to make appearances.  The film's stunt coordinator also made an appearance as the dog trainer while Bolt's girlfriend and sister both appeared as zombies.
In March 2001, the official website was set up, which revealed the film's original October 26, 2001 release
In May 2001, it was announced that Sony Pictures Entertainment would distribute the film in North America.
In December 2001, Sony gave fans a chance to design the film's poster with a prize of an undisclosed amount of cash, a free screening of the film, and with the final design being the film's poster.
On June 29, 2004, over two years after the film's release, a novelization by Keith R. A. DeCandido was published. DeCandido also wrote novelizations for the Resident Evil: Apocalypse|second film, which was published only two months later, and the Resident Evil: Extinction|third film in 2007.
The film opened in 2,528 theaters and grossed $17,707,106 on its opening weekend (March 15-17, 2002). The film grossed $40,119,709 domestically and $102,441,078 worldwide.
After commercial success at the box office, a sequel, ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' (2004) was released. This was followed by ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' (2007), ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' (2010), ''Resident Evil: Retribution'' (2012) and ''Resident Evil: The Final Chapter'' (2016). Anderson did not direct the second or third films due to filming commitments with ''Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator'' (2004) and ''Death Race'' (2008).
''Resident Evil'' received a 34% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 124 reviews. Robert K. Elder from the ''Chicago Tribune'' stated: the film "updates the zombie genre with an anti-corporate message while still scaring its audience and providing heart-pounding action", while Owen Gleiberman from ''Entertainment Weekly'' noted: the film is as "impersonal in its relentlessness as the video-game series that inspired it."
Both ''Resident Evil'' and the sequel appear on Roger Ebert's most hated films list, published in 2005. The New York Times' Stephen Holden awarded Resident Evil 1.5 stars out of 5 saying that "it has a frantic staccato that is more game-oriented than cinematic".http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil
In 2014, filmmaker James Cameron named ''Resident Evil'' his biggest guilty pleasure.

Various elements are borrowed from numerous video games including ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', where Alice's character awakes in Raccoon City Hospital with a viral outbreak occurring in the city. There are several references to characters and organizations such as the Umbrella Corporation, the Nemesis program, the underground train bearing the moniker "Alexi-5000" a reference to ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica''
Other references to the first game include Alice examining the Arklay Research Facility#Spencer Mansion in other media|mansion by going outside; crows are visible for a moment. Crows are minor enemies that the player encounters throughout each game. Alice finds a picture of her wedding day with Spence, which is the same style as the photos in the first version of the ''Resident Evil'' game: in black and white with the foreground image noticeably Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|spliced onto the background. On the newspaper at the end of the film, the words ''"Horror in Raccoon City! More Victims Dead!"'' are shown in the upper right corner. This is a reference to the same newspaper in the censored opening of the first ''Resident Evil'' game and the prologue chapter for the ''Resident Evil (1996 video game)#Novelization|Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy'' novel. Near the beginning of the film, Alice examines a statue after the wind blows its cover off. This statue is similar in design to one in the mansion of the first game.
When returning to the Red Queen's chamber, Kaplan points out that the four bodies of the group's dead crew from the Glass Hallway Trap sequence are gone. This is a reference to the games, where the bodies of enemies disappear. When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the ''Resident Evil'' game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.
A faux newspaper created by Screen Gems for ''Apocalypse'', ''The Raccoon City Times'', indicates hours after the initial outbreak when creatures began appearing in the Arklay Mountains feasting on victims.  This is similar to the opening of the first video game. - sonypictures.com 
Anderson has stated that the film's camera angles and several shots allude to the video game's camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the security guard. These include a scene near the beginning where there is a close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the first game. In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.
''Resident Evil'' was released on VHS and DVD on July 30, 2002 in the United States, It was a special edition release, with a number of documentaries including five featurettes, one of which explained the making of ''Resident Evil'', the film's score composition, costume design, set design, zombie make up tests, and the music video for a remixed version of "My Plague" by Slipknot.

Film critics criticized the film for its characters, plot, and acting while praising the 3D, visual effects, and fight choreography. The Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray and DVD for the film was released on December 21, 2012.
Alice and the others on the Umbrella Corporation freighter Arcadia face an attack by a fleet of tiltrotors led by Alice's former ally, Jill Valentine. Alice is captured in the attack, while the fates of Chris Redfield, Claire Redfield and K-Mart are left ambiguous.
Alice awakens in an underground facility and is interrogated by Jill. During a power failure, Alice escapes her cell and the laser grid, finding herself in a simulated Shibuya Square, Tokyo. Fighting her way out against zombies, she enters a control room and encounters Ada Wong, one of Albert Wesker's top agents. Ada explains that they no longer serve Umbrella and the power outage was staged by Wesker hacking into the facility's computers. Wesker appears on a screen, revealing that the Red Queen now controls Umbrella. Ada explains that the facility is underwater, located in Kamchatka, Russia, that served as a former Soviet naval outpost. The facility was designed by Umbrella in manufacturing clones and created simulated outbreaks to show the effect of the T-virus. Ada and Alice plan to rendezvous with a rescue crew, which includes Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton and Luther West, Alice's ally which has survived after the outbreak on Los Angeles. Leon's team plants explosives near the entrance of the facility, which will detonate in two hours to ensure the facility's destruction. The group plans to meet with Alice and Ada in the Raccoon City suburbia area. In a New York City simulation, Alice and Ada defeat two Axemen. Leon and his team enter a Moscow simulation, but are attacked by armed Las Plagas Undead.
In the Suburban setting, Alice and Ada encounter Becky, the deaf daughter of another Alice clone who mistakes the real Alice for her mother. They also encounter clones of Alice's former compatriots, the One, Rain Ocampo and Carlos Olivera, who are sent to capture them. Ada gives Alice her smart glasses so that she and Becky can find their way and become split up. They encounter another clone of Rain, who was a friend of Becky's mother and Alice gives her a weapon. She then rescues Leon's surviving crew from the barrage of zombies and a giant Licker. Once united, the heroes head for the facility exit but are assaulted by the clones and Becky is captured by the Licker. Alice rescues her, using Leon's bombs, kills the Licker and allows the heroes to escape''';''' the good Rain clone and Barry are killed during the battle.
On the surface, their snow-mobile is knocked over by Jill Valentine's submarine. Jill and Rain confront the heroes with Ada as their hostage. Jill and Alice begin fighting each other, while Rain - now also enhanced with Las Plagas, granting her superhuman power and healing, fights Leon and Luther. Rain knocks out Leon and kills Luther. Alice is able to tear the mind-controlling scarab from Jill's chest, returning her to her normal self. Realizing that they can't kill Rain, Alice shoots the ice under Rain's feet and she is dragged down by the swimming zombies from the undersea installation and killed. Alice, Ada, Becky, Leon, and Jill travel to Wesker's headquarters, the heavily barricaded and fortified White House, staffed by STARS and the U.S. military. Alice meets Wesker in the heavily-barricaded Oval Office, where he injects her with the T-virus, returning her superhuman abilities; as only Alice successfully bonded with it, she is the ultimate weapon. On the roof, Wesker explains the Red Queen is trying to wipe out humanity, and all of the remaining uninfected are in the base; it is humanity's last stand.

After the release of ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'', director Paul W. S. Anderson was in discussion with Screen Gems of filming a fifth and sixth film back to back. But Anderson later decided to just focus on ''Resident Evil: Retribution''. Anderson returned as writer and director, Glen McPherson serves as director of photography, Kevin Phipps as production designer, and Nick Powell as both a fight choreographer and second-unit director.
When Ada and Alice encounter each other the first time they recreate a scene from ''Resident Evil 4'' in their brief fight. An element from ''Resident Evil 4'', a parasite called Las Plagas plays a part in the film and allows the undead to "run around, ride motorbikes, and shoot machine guns." An action scene inspired by ''Resident Evil 5'' where the characters are driving a Hummer while being chased by zombies is featured, but for the film the Hummer was changed to a Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls Royce Phantom. The metal bug on Jill Valentine's chest can be seen in ''Resident Evil 5''.
Aside from the video games, writing for the film was heavily influenced by science-fiction films. "I think ''Inception'' had a huge impact on everyone," says Bolt, "and I think ''Westworld'' is an important film to Paul. Everybody knows, because he talks about it enough, the Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' series, ''Blade Runner'', all these things are inspirations."
Makeup effects supervisor Paul Jones stated that he wanted the makeup on the zombies to look realistic. He took inspiration from Day of the Dead (1985 film)|''Day of the Dead''.
The film's fight sequences were influenced by Asian cinema. "We watched a lot of Thai movies this time around because of the movies (Powell) has done," says Anderson. "He did ''The Last Samurai'' as well. He has worked with a lot of Japanese stuntmen and he has worked with a lot of Hong Kong stuntmen. But we felt the area that hadn't been mined by western cinema much was that whole kind of high impact Thai style of fighting. So we just watched a lot of action sequences from a lot of Thai movies. There were moves and just a general feel that we thought we could infuse the movie with. You know, that kind of bone crunch where you really feel the impact. We tried to bring that into the movie, which is also good for 3D because obviously 3D makes it harder to sell those kind of fake phony punches because you see the distance between the fist and the face. So that kind of Thai style of fighting where you actually make contact is a lot stronger."
 in promotion of ''Resident Evil: Retribution''.
Returning from the previous film are: Milla Jovovich as Alice, Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine) and Boris Kodjoe (Luther West).
The characters, Ada Wong (played by Li Bingbing), Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb) Ali Larter (Claire Redfield), Wentworth Miller (Chris Redfield) and Spencer Locke (K-Mart (Resident Evil)|K-Mart) do not return and they are presumed to have died in the attack on Arcadia or held captive elsewhere by Umbrella. Also, a new character portrayed by Aryana Engineer has been added to the franchise cast.
Principal photography started on October 10 and wrapped on December 23, 2011 for a 55-day shoot.
On October 11, a platform collapsed during the second day of filming and injured 16 people on the set. According to Toronto police, ten people were taken to the hospital for emergency treatment. Injuries included bruises and broken bones. Emergency workers had a difficult time determining which injuries were real since the people were dressed in zombie costumes with fake blood.
The streets of Red Square were cleared for a day and background filming was done in the Russian subway after it was cleared for five hours (although the subway station scene is actually the Lower Bay abandoned station of Toronto subway). Most of the streets were built into sets. The car chase scene was filmed in late November in Moscow.
Durand and Roberts wrapped filming in the first week of December and Li wrapped on December 14. A fight scene between Jill and Alice that involved over 200 moves began filming December 14 until the end of production.
The music group Tomandandy, who performed the ''Resident Evil: Afterlife|Afterlife'' score, returned to score ''Resident Evil: Retribution''. Anderson explains that the score for this film will be a progression of ''Afterlife'', stating that he "wants to kind of mesh their more electronic stuff with an orchestra this time. It still has that cool tomandandy feel, but it has a more epic scope to it." The official soundtrack will be released on September 11, 2012 under Milan Records, which will include tomandandy's score for the film, as well as the film's end credits song "Hexes" produced by Bassnectar featuring Chino Moreno (of the Deftones) on vocals.
Singer Mika Nakashima will sing the theme song for the Japanese version of the film.
The first teaser trailer of the film was attached to ''Underworld: Awakening'', an installment from ''Resident Evil'''s rival film series, and released in January 2012, featuring product placement promoting Sony products such as the Xperia phone, the PlayStation Vita and the Tablet S before transitioning into a post-apocalyptic Washington, D.C., with Alice standing on the roof of the White House, in similar fashion to the promotion for previous installments, Resident Evil: Apocalypse|''Apocalypse'' and Resident Evil: Extinction|''Extinction''.
A viral website, UmbrellaCorporation.net, supposedly informed about Umbrella, reported that it was on a recruitment tour all over the world searching for "great minds to help them advance". On several occasions, a video of Alice (Milla Jovovich) appeared, telling the viewer not to trust Umbrella. At the same time, an actual mobile tour for the film was launched, travelling to Cancún, Barcelona, Poznan, Warsaw and Rome. Furthermore, a black, tinted SUV with the Umbrella Corporation symbol and name on its doors and license plate was seen in Atlanta in June.
A second trailer premiered online on June 14, following a live Q&A with Milla Jovovich in New York City and was attached to prints of That's My Boy (2012 film)|''That's My Boy''.
Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr, Boris Kodjoe, Mika Nakashima and Paul W. S. Anderson appeared at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con Convention on Friday, July 13. A discussion for the film took place, and never-before-seen footage debuted.
On August 10, 2012, a group of 27 people dressed as zombies "invaded" the Shibuya shopping district and handed out leaflets to promote the film. The group marched across the crossing in front of the Shibuya Station and then moved on to Shibuya's underground shopping area "Shibuchika" and to the "Shibuya Cine Palace".
''Resident Evil: Retribution'' was released worldwide on September 14, 2012 in 3D, IMAX 3D, and 2D. The MPAA's official rating for the film is R for "sequences of strong violence throughout".
The film's world premiere took place in Tokyo, Japan (where the film was retitled ''Biohazard V: Retribution'') on September 3. Originally, a promotional stunt was planned that involved Jovovich pretending to come out with a gun and shoot "zombies" in the theater. In response to the Aurora shootings, Jovovich declined the stunt, commenting that "There's absolutely no way I'm doing anything violent in a movie theater." Jovovich, Anderson, and Nakashima appeared at the premiere for a red carpet event.
Li Bingbing did not appear at the premiere, raising speculation from reporters that her absence was a demonstration against the escalating dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku Islands. Li's agent Ji Xiang explained that Li had been informed of the premiere two months before but she was too busy in Beijing to attend at that time. However, Ji did not deny that politics were involved, saying: "We are in line with our government - the Diaoyu Islands belong to China. Bingbing will be attending movie premieres held in other places across the world and she skipped the Tokyo leg only."
The film was released on December 21, 2012 on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultraviolet Digital Copy. The United Kingdom release is set for January 28, 2013, also on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultraviolet Digital Copy. Pre-order for was available in November 2012 on Amazon.com|Amazon.
''Resident Evil: Retribution'' opened at #1 in 3,012 theaters, beating out the 3-D re-release of ''Finding Nemo''. During its opening weekend, the film grossed $21,052,227 domestically (an average of $6,989 for each theater), which makes the film the second lowest domestic opening weekend in the series, with the lowest being the original Resident Evil (film)|''Resident Evil'' ($17.7 million), though it sold the least tickets. The audience in the opening weekend was 64% male, and 55% were 25 years of age or older. Regular 3D showings accounted for 48% of ticket sales, while IMAX 3D contributed 14% and other large format showings contributed 4%.
''Resident Evil: Retribution'' broke the series record for the highest worldwide opening with $49.6 million, beating out ''Afterlife'''s opening of over $39 million. In its opening weekend, the film was strongest in Asia, where it had the best 2012 Hollywood debut so far in Japan ($11.2 million), Taiwan ($4.4 million) and Malaysia ($2 million). Its premiere in South Korea ($2 million) was underwhelming, where it underperformed to the local film Masquerade (2012 film)|''Masquerade'' ($7.3 million). Elsewhere, the movie did very good business in Russia ($8.5 million) and Brazil ($3.1 million), but was disappointing in Australia ($1.5 million).
Worldwide, the film grossed $240 million, after the movie opened in China on 17 March. Although this does not match it's predecessor's gross of $296 million, it still ranks as the second highest grossing in the series, the highest grossing foreign film in Japan in 2012 (7th overall), and the highest grossing Canadian film of 2012, and second of all time (behind ''Afterlife'').
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 31% based on reviews from 65 critics, with an average rating of 4.4 out of 10. The critical consensus on the site is "Resident Evil: Retribution offers everything one might reasonably expect from the fifth installment in a heavily action-dependent franchise -- which means very little beyond stylishly hollow CGI-enhanced set pieces".
Jim Vejvoda at IGN gave the film a 6 out of 10, saying, "Even with all of its dopey dialogue, wooden characters and 'been there, done that' elements, ''Resident Evil: Retribution'' is pretty amazing as far as entries in this series go. It certainly feels more like a video game and has a bit more emotion to it than some of the past ''Resident Evil'' sequels, but if you don't like this series then there's not much here to make you suddenly warm up to it."

A sixth film was confirmed by Sony distribution's head, Rory Bruer.
In February 2014, Collider reported that, according to Paul W.S. Anderson, there were no immediate plans in motion for a sixth installment in the popular franchise, but that both Anderson and Screen Gems were eager to add at least one more entry to the series. He said they would "like to do another ''Resident Evil'' movie, but the wheels aren't quite in motion yet." The film was released on January 27, 2017.

'''''Resident Evil: Afterlife''''' is a 2010 3-D film|3D science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. It stars Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Kim Coates, Shawn Roberts, Spencer Locke, Boris Kodjoe, and Wentworth Miller. The film marks Anderson's second time to direct in the series, the first being the first installment. It is the first to be shot in 3D and fourth installment in the Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series, which is based on the Capcom survival horror video game series of the same name.
The film follows Alice searching for and rescuing the remaining survivors in Los Angeles after the T-virus outbreak, and teaming up against Albert Wesker, the head of the Umbrella Corporation. Chris Redfield, a primary character from the video games, was featured for the first time in the film franchise. Other characters from the games and films who returned are: Claire Redfield, Chris's sister who has lost her memory prior to the film's events; Albert Wesker, the film's main antagonist; and Jill Valentine, who made a cameo appearance.
In May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following ''Extinction'' with a sequel titled ''Afterlife''. ''Extinction'' was released in 2007 and was a box office success prompting ''Afterlife'' to begin development in June 2008, with the script being written by Anderson that December. Elements from the video game ''Resident Evil 5'' (2009) were incorporated into the film. Filming took place in Toronto from September to December 2009 using the 3D Fusion Camera System.
The film was released in 3D and IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D theaters on September 10, 2010. The film grossed $60 million in the United States and Canada on an estimated $60 million budget, and made $240 million in other markets surpassing the previous film's overseas total in the second week of release. Grossing a worldwide total of $300 million, ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' became the highest-grossing entry of the series with the overseas total almost equaling the previous films' overseas total combined. ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' was released to DVD, Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray, and Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D on December 28, 2010 in the United States.
Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her clones attack Umbrella HQ, Tokyo, slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who escapes in a tiltrotor plane and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive sinkhole; however, the real Alice boarded beforehand. Wesker injects her with an Anti-Virus to remove her superhuman abilities, before the autopilot crashes the plane and Alice appears to be the only survivor.
Six months later, Alice travels to Alaska in an Yak-52|airplane, tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called ''Arcadia''; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of L.A., where they find survivors living in a prison surrounded by infected. They meet Luther West, (Boris Kodjoe) who leads the surviving band on prison, Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Barnfield), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice lands on the prison's roof and learns ''Arcadia'' isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to peep. They are attacked by a group of infected that dug into the prison, and take Wendell; she manages to kill them.
Desperate, they free Chris, who reveals that Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine and it would take a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for ''Arcadia'' in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.
Alice and the Redfields board the ''Arcadia'', discovering it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers ''Arcadia'' is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows a trail of blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite bonding with the virus at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over effects of the T-virus.
The Redfields fight Wesker while Alice battles Bennett, now working for Wesker. Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. They lock Bennett in the room with Wesker's corpse. Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives. Wesker then escapes in an aircraft, activating a bomb on the ''Arcadia''; the plane explodes instead as Alice placed the bomb there beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, Wesker parachutes away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn ''Arcadia'' into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors. As Alice, Claire and Chris watch over from ''Arcadia'', it is approached by a military squadron of Umbrella aircraft.
During the post-credits scene in one of the aircraft, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), who went missing after ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', is dictating the attack wearing the same mind control device used on Claire.

'' was a practical joke with his imprisonment and his first line being, "I know a way out of here."
In May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following ''Extinction'' with a sequel entitled ''Afterlife'', to be shot and set in Tokyo, Japan and Alaska. Despite ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' being billed on the official website and elsewhere as the final installment of the ''Resident Evil'' film series; on September 23, 2007, Rory Bruer, Sony's head of distribution explained, "It absolutely would not surprise me considering the success of the franchise that they find a way to come up with another. It's a real possibility." Producer Jeremy Bolt also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film, that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility.  In June 2008, Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film. In December 2008, Anderson stated that he was working on the script. The following year, it was announced that Sony was aiming to release ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' by August 27, 2010.
In September 2006, reports indicated that casting for the fourth film had begun, with Jensen Ackles being considered for the role of Leon S. Kennedy.  Ali Larter missed seven episodes of filming the television show ''Heroes'' in order to appear in the film. Before Wentworth Miller was cast as Chris Redfield, actor Johnny Messner auditioned for the role. Having never played the ''Resident Evil'' video games, Miller began preparing for the role by searching the internet for images of Chris Redfield. Much to his surprise, he noticed how muscular the character was; with only three weeks to prep before shooting, he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent. He was shown video footage of the games and saw how he was visually different, especially in the first game. He did cardio to build up endurance.  Miller described his interpretation on the character from the video game as, "He's definitely capable and heroic, but there's also something quite innocent. He was still freshly scrubbed, in a way, at the beginning of this horrifying journey." He described his take as the character in the film, "My Chris has been walking down this particular road for quite some time. The edges are sharper, and they're way more jagged."
Shawn Roberts was originally going to audition for Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role. He went to audition for the role of Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, "[He's the] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's got everything going for him-he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate-it's all the elements from the game. That was one thing we all agreed on from the start: this character has to be for the fans." Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine, who was last seen in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. She is featured briefly in a scene shown during the credits, setting up the Resident Evil: Retribution|sequel.
Anderson was shown footage of James Cameron's ''Avatar'' which sold him on the idea to shoot ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition video|high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more specifically a Sony F35 camera. The crew spent two weeks in pre-production learning the 3D camera system. With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.
's exterior was used to portray the prison.
 was used to portray Umbrella Corporation's underground Tokyo headquarters.  Anderson said "It had a fantastic atrium that had these huge floating pill shapes in it. Inside the pills were conference rooms. We shot at night so there was no ambient light coming into the glass, and then with visual effects replaced the glass with concrete walls".
For slow motion scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom high-speed cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the ''Resident Evil 5'' game was recreated shot-by-shot for the film and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers were not able to use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yakovlev Yak-52|Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.
The 3D cameras were unable to pick up anything shiny, such as stainless steel, due to a flare. Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light.  So we had to add more and more black.  The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before."
Principal photography was done mostly at Cinespace Film Studios in  Toronto, Ontario. Toronto police received hundreds of calls from concerned neighbors after a scene involving a burning plane crashed.  For the underwater scenes, cargo shipping containers were cut and welded to make a giant tank on stage. The opening scene was filmed at the Shibuya Crossing in Shibuya, Tokyo. Interior scenes  of Umbrella Corporation's subterranean lair were filmed at the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy. Robarts Library was used to portray exterior shots of a Los Angeles prison due to its resemblance to a prison, and other scenes were shot at University of Toronto Scarborough. Scenes portraying an Alaskan aircraft boneyard were actually filmed at Oshawa Airport. A location depicting an Alaskan beach was filmed at Sandbanks Provincial Park.  Second unit was sent to Alaska to capture establishing shots of the scenery.
Visual effects were done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones served as the special effects creator, who previously designed the Nemesis character in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described the look of the film, "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of ''Silent Hill''. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been fun to see those looks." A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, "In a world that has gone to hell in a handbasket, there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's going to happen to LA is it's going to get burned."
The infected Dobermans from the games and previous films return, but are more advanced. The dogs wore a costume with prosthetics.  Anderson wanted to make the dogs in this film look "absolutely terrible". Computer-generated imagery|Computer effects were used to make the dog's jaw flare open, with tentacles coming out of their mouths similar to the dogs from the fourth and fifth video games. Other creatures borrowed from the fifth video game are the "Majini" who are more intelligent and have mandibles and tentacles coming out of their mouths, and "The Executioner" (named the Axeman in the film).

''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' was not screened in advance for critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 23% based on reviews 95 critics, with a rating average of 4.1 out of 10. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B-" on an A+ to F scale.
Michael Ordoña of the ''Los Angeles Times'' gave it a positive review, noting the slower cut of the film and saying "the action is easier to read than in most films of the genre, and therefore more enjoyable. Anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for the stereoscopic buck". Phelim O'Neill of ''The Guardian'' gave the film two stars out of five praising the use of 3D, while stating that the ''Resident Evil'' films "always look good and have well-staged action, but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination". ''Chicago Reader''s Andrea Gronvall described the plot as "nearly indiscernible" but did call the film the "sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit".
Jeannette Catsoulis of ''The New York Times'' gave the film a negative review, saying "Cannibalizing John Carpenter's ''Thing'' and much of the sci-fi-horror canon, ''Afterlife'' is more moribund than its thronging undead". David Edwards of the ''Daily Mirror'' compared it to ''Resident Evil: Extinction'', stating that the "results are even less impressive, which is saying quite something" and "only fans of the series will care with the film looking suspiciously like a series of barely connected action scenes and unimpressive 3D welded to a who-the-hell-cares? plot". Spill.com critics Corey Koleman and Co-Host 3000 gave the film a "Some ol' bullshit", the site's second lowest rating. They criticized the film's overuse of slow motion, lack of explanation of certain plot elements and long lapses in between action, but gave the film points for its cinematography, small bits of action, 3D and the special effects of the Axeman. Andrew Barker of ''Variety'' compared the film to the previous installment as "equally moribund, and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative". He compared Roberts' Wesker to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith from ''The Matrix'', calling it a "slipshod impression". A particularly scathing review came from Brian Orndorf of Dark Horizons, who commented: "Perhaps the first 3D motion picture to simulate the experience of watching paint dry, ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' is a dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life."

'''''Resident Evil: The Final Chapter''''' is a 2016 science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. It is the sequel to ''Resident Evil: Retribution'' (2012) and the sixth and final installment in the Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series, which is loosely based on the Capcom survival horror video game series ''Resident Evil''. The film stars Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Shawn Roberts, Ruby Rose, Eoin Macken, William Levy, and Iain Glen. In the film, Alice and her friends are betrayed by Albert Wesker, who gathers the entire forces of Umbrella into one final strike against the apocalypse survivors.
It was released on December 23, 2016, in Japan and on January 27, 2017, in the United States in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. The film received mixed reviews and has grossed over $306 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film in the franchise.
Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus developed the T-virus as a way to cure all diseases on Earth. After having had his creation taken away from him, Marcus' business partner Dr. Alexander Isaacs tried to convince Marcus to use the T-virus for military purposes. When he refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill Marcus.
Some time after the events of Resident Evil: Retribution|the previous film, Alice awakens in the now-ruined White House, after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While searching for survivors, the Red Queen appears and tells Alice she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City within 48 hours, where the Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which will kill every organism infected by the T-virus, before the remainder of humankind is wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen says that she will explain once Alice arrives at The Hive. Alice destroys a giant creature to escape Washington, D.C.
On her way to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs, whose clone Alice Resident Evil: Extinction|previously killed, but she escapes his convoy. Alice later arrives in the now-destroyed Raccoon City and is captured by a group of survivors, consisting of Doc, Abigail, Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Claire Redfield, who is revealed to be alive after the attack on Arcadia. After learning a group of armored vehicles and a horde of zombies is coming their way, the group prepares to make their last stand. They defeat the enemy forces, although Cobalt is killed. The group later realizes that a second horde is coming in their direction.
With no defenses left, Alice and the crew decide to get to the Hive entrance, located at the bottom of the atomic bomb crater which destroyed the city. However, Wesker, having taken control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian. Upon arriving at the Hive, the Red Queen appears again to Alice and explains the reason of her betrayal. She revealed that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of the Umbrella executives, including Isaacs, having a meeting regarding the world, formulating a plan to release the T-virus on purpose in order to cleanse the world, save the rich and powerful with cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive, and later rebuild the world in their image. The Red Queen, although programmed to never hurt an Umbrella employee, was also programmed to value human life, which is why she enlists Alice's help in order to stop Isaacs. The Red Queen also warns Alice about one of the group being a spy for Umbrella.
Entering the Hive, the group encounter several traps, and Abigail and Razor are killed. After planting bombs around the Hive, Alice confronts the real Isaacs, while she and Claire are captured by Wesker and Doc, Umbrella's spy. A cryogenic capsule opens, revealing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-leader and Marcus's daughter; Alice is revealed to be just a clone of Alicia. Isaacs plans to eliminate Alicia and gain full control of Umbrella, but Alicia "fires" Wesker, which signals the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but his gun is empty - as Alice had deduced his treachery earlier - and he is shot dead by Claire.
Encouraged by Alicia's words, Alice and Claire fight Isaacs, who is eventually killed by his own clone - the one Alice had encountered en route to the city - and Alice releases the antivirus, killing the undead. The bombs planted within the Hive explode, killing everyone inside, including Alicia, all the frozen Umbrella employees, and Wesker. Claire later wakes Alice, who survived as the antivirus killed the T-virus within Alice's body. The Red Queen gives Alice an upload of all Alicia's memories of childhood. Some time later, Alice travels to Manhattan, stating that the antivirus could take several years to reach all corners of the globe and until then, her mission is not over, as several large creatures pursue her.

Alex Welch of IGN was critical of the film, giving 3/10 and calling it "a pointless mess from beginning to end", and "nothing more than a barrage of cliched character beats, unbearable CGI action, and headache-inducing editing".
In contrast, Bill Zwecker of ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave the film 3 stars out of 4, saying it "[gets] the storyline right off the bat". He adds, "For fans of ''Resident Evil,'' I believe this final film will not disappoint, but it also will likely encourage newcomers to the saga to go back and play a bit of catch-up by watching the earlier movies".

Elizabeth meets a charming soldier named Wickham (Jack Huston), and arranges to meet him at another ball. She travels with him to a church that is filled with zombies who feed on pig brains instead of human brains, keeping their behaviour relatively normal. Wickham believes that with these new civilised zombies, humans can coexist peacefully with them. He asks Elizabeth to elope with him, but she backs off. Elizabeth learns that Darcy convinced the Bingleys to leave to keep Bingley away from Jane. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, having fallen in love with her, she expresses outrage at his actions and fights him.
Darcy later writes Elizabeth a letter to apologise. He reiterates that he separated Jane and Bingley for fear that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth, having overheard Mrs. Bennet drunkenly mention it. He also exposes Wickham's true nature: he and Wickham were childhood friends but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered the inheritance he did receive and tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate, then tried to elope with Darcy's little sister for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has taken Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is actually using the 'civilised' zombies to create a zombie army which has overrun London based on Wickham's planning, and will rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.
While fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, staying civilized by consuming pig brains. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham. As the two ride across the bridge, the army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion, and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again, and this time, she agrees. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane.
In a mid-credits scene, Wickham leads a horde of zombies toward the wedding celebration with the Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse riding behind him.

In October 2014, ''Entertainment Weekly'' published the first photo from the production. In July 2015, Lily James, Sam Riley, Bella Heathcote, Douglas Booth, Jack Huston, Matt Smith, Burr Steers and Seth Grahame-Smith appeared at a panel at Comic-Con to promote the film, where the first trailer debuted.

''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' grossed $10.9 million in North America and $5.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $16.4 million, against a budget of $28 million.
The film was released in North America on February 5, 2016, alongside ''Hail, Caesar!'' and ''The Choice''. The film was projected to gross $10-12 million from 2,931 theaters in its opening weekend.
The film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 43%, based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' manages to wring a few fun moments out of its premise, but never delivers the thoroughly kooky mashup its title suggests."
Rafer Guzmán of ''Newsday'' wrote positively about the film, giving the film three out of four stars, calling it "an unexpected and off-kilter treat, thanks to a BBC-quality cast and (un)deadpan humor."
Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com gave the film one and a half out of four stars, saying "Like the novel ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'', the movie ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' is predicated on a simple, single gimmick: It's ''Pride and Prejudice'' … with zombies. This is a vaguely amusing idea which somehow got stretched out to an entire book, which somehow became a best seller, which inevitably means it had to be made into a film."
Literary scholar and Austen professor Devoney Looser stated in ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine her opinion that the film's first half, and especially Matt Smith's Mr. Collins, were comic, jarring, and enjoyable. She assessed the film overall with, "I laughed a lot and I shrieked. I was wavering between B+ and A-. I'm willing to bump it up for its originality and live with my grade-inflation reputation: A-." Zombie expert Clark Collis did not rate the film quite as high: "I enjoy genre movies that attempt something different-and this does-but I didn't find it all that scary. I'd give it a 'B'".

'''''Sugar Hill''''' is a 1974 American horror blaxploitation zombie film released by AIP. It starred Marki Bey as the title character who uses voodoo to get revenge on the people responsible for her boyfriend's death. The zombies in this film more closely resemble the creatures of Haitian Vodou#Myths and misconceptions|voodoo legend - i.e., the walking dead who do the bidding of a human master - than the flesh-eating "living dead" ghouls popularized by George A. Romero. According to the film, the zombies are the preserved bodies of slaves brought to the United States from Guinea. American International Pictures had previously combined the horror and blaxploitation genres with ''Blacula'' (1972) and its sequel, ''Scream Blacula Scream'' (1973).
The story centers on Diana "Sugar" Hill (Bey), a voodoo queen using zombies to take revenge on a group of white thugs, led by mob boss Morgan (Robert Quarry). Hill's boyfriend, nightclub owner Langston (Larry D. Johnson), had been killed by Morgan's men when he refused to sell the club. With a former practitioner named Mama Maitresse (Zara Cully), she intends on destroying the men who killed her boyfriend and now want her club. Helping her out is the voodoo lord of the dead, Baron Samedi (Don Pedro Colley).

'''''World War Z''''' is a 2013 American action horror film directed by Marc Forster. The screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard, and Damon Lindelof is from a screen story by Carnahan and J. Michael Straczynski, based on the title of the 2006 novel of the same name by Max Brooks. The film stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator who must travel the world to find a way to stop a zombie pandemic.
Pitt's Plan B Entertainment secured the film rights in 2007, and Forster was approached to direct. In 2009, Carnahan was hired to rewrite the script. Filming began in July 2011 in Malta, on an estimated $125 million budget, before moving to Glasgow in August 2011 and Budapest in October 2011. Originally set for a December 2012 release, the production suffered some setbacks. In June 2012, the film's release date was pushed back, and the crew returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting. Damon Lindelof was hired to rewrite the third act, but did not have time to finish the script, and Drew Goddard was hired to rewrite it. The reshoots took place between September and October 2012.
''World War Z'' premiered in London on June 2, 2013, and was chosen to open the 35th Moscow International Film Festival. The film premiered in New York, and Los Angeles on June 14, 2013, and released everywhere on June 21, 2013, in the United States, in 2D and RealD 3D. The film received positive reviews for Brad Pitt's performance and as a realistic revival of the zombie genre, but received certain criticism for the anti-climax and outdated CGI. Regardless, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $540 million against a production budget of $190 million, becoming the highest-grossing zombie film of all time. A sequel was announced shortly after the film's release; it was tentatively scheduled for a June 2017 release, but has since been delayed.
Former UN employee Gerry Lane, his wife Karin and their two daughters are in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is attacked by zombies. As chaos spreads, the Lanes escape to Newark, New Jersey and take refuge in an apartment, home to a couple with a young son, Tommy. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni-an old friend of Gerry's-sends a helicopter that extracts the Lanes and Tommy to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the worldwide outbreaks. Dr. Andrew Fassbach posits that the plague is a virus, and that development of a vaccine depends on finding the origin. Gerry reluctantly agrees to help Fassbach find the outbreak's source after it is made clear that he and his family will be removed from the ship if he does not.
Gerry and Fassbach fly to Camp Humphreys, a military base in South Korea, where they are attacked on arrival by zombies. Turning to re-enter the aircraft, Fassbach slips, falls and accidentally discharges his gun, killing himself. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel, led by Captain Speke, Gerry learns that the infection was introduced to the base by its doctor, who was ultimately incinerated by a soldier with a lame leg who the infected ignored. A former CIA operative, imprisoned at the base, tells Gerry to go to Jerusalem, where he says a safe zone has been maintained by the Israeli Mossad since before the outbreak's official acknowledgement. As Gerry and his team bike back to their aircraft, zombies attack, kill several soldiers and infect Captain Speke, who commits suicide to prevent himself from turning. Gerry and his pilot escape.
In Jerusalem, Gerry meets Mossad chief Jurgen Warmbrunn, who explains that months earlier, the Mossad had intercepted a Indian military message claiming that Indian troops were fighting the ''rakshasa'', or "dead spirits". Israel had thereupon quarantined Jerusalem, erecting huge walls around it. Just as Jurgen shows Gerry that Israel is allowing survivors to take refuge in the city, loud celebratory singing from refugees prompts zombies to scale the walls and attack. Jurgen orders some Israeli soldiers to escort Gerry back to his plane. On the way, Gerry notices zombies ignoring an emaciated boy. Soon after, one of Gerry's escorts, a soldier who identifies herself only as "Segen", is bitten in the hand, which Gerry quickly amputates to stop her turning. Gerry and Segen escape on a commercial airliner as Israel is overrun.
Gerry contacts Thierry, and the airliner is diverted to a World Health Organization (WHO) facility outside Cardiff, Wales. When a stowaway zombie attacks in mid-air, Gerry uses a grenade to blow the infected out of the aircraft, but this also causes them to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff a theory he has, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill, since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting somebody with a pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie corners Gerry inside the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown bacteria and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerry's success.
Gerry and his family are reunited in a safe zone at Freeport, Nova Scotia. A "vaccine", derived from deadly pathogens, is developed and issued to troops battling the infected, acting as a kind of camouflage. The vaccine also helps survivors to reach quarantine zones. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. "This isn't the end," Gerry comments, "Not even close. ''Our war'' has just begun."

After a bidding war with Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way, Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment secured the screen rights to the novel in 2007.
An early script was leaked onto the internet in March 2008, leading to a review by Ain't It Cool News which called it "[not] just a good adaptation of a difficult book [but] a genre-defining piece of work that could well see us all arguing about whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material". The review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to ''Children of Men'', following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are "starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind."
In July 2009, Brooks revealed that the script was being re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan. Brooks believed that this "show[ed] [the producer's] confidence in this project" because of the amount of money that was being invested in it.
Pre-production began in April 2011 with Robert Richardson announced as the cinematographer.
, August 2011
On a budget of $125 million, ''World War Z'' began principal photography in July 2011 in Malta, with the first images of production being released a few days later.
In August 2011, Bryan Cranston entered negotiations to join the film in a "small but flashy" role but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. Also in August, filming was set to take place along a road on the perimeter of the Grangemouth Refinery in Grangemouth, Scotland. The location was chosen for the length of the road which is crucial to the shot.
The filmmakers initially intended to film a climactic battle scene set in Russia, and the crew moved to Budapest to film it there.
In May 2012, production returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting.
The re-shoots coupled with other overages caused the budget to balloon to around $190 million, which shocked Paramount president Marc Evans.
In March 2013, it was reported that Paramount changed a scene in the film in which the characters speculate that the zombie outbreak originated in mainland China in hopes of landing a distribution deal in the country.
In December 2011, it was reported that Marco Beltrami had signed on to score ''World War Z''.
 
''World War Z'' was initially scheduled for release by Paramount and Skydance on December 21, 2012, but in March 2012 it was pushed back to June 21, 2013. Paramount elected to release ''Jack Reacher'' on the December 2012 date.
''World War Z'' grossed $202.4 million in North America, and $337.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $540 million. ''Variety'' called it a bona-fide box office hit.
In North America, ''World War Z'' earned $25.20 million on its opening Friday,
In other territories, the film earned $5.7 million on its opening day (Thursday, June 20, 2013) and $45.8 million on its opening weekend, ranking in third place.
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, ''World War Z'' has a 67% approval rating, based on 252 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site summary states "It's uneven and diverges from the source book, but ''World War Z'' still brings smart, fast-moving thrills and a solid performance from Brad Pitt to the zombie genre."
Richard Roeper of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave the film a 3.5 out of 4, saying "It's entertaining as hell" and it provides "nearly non-stop action". Peter Travers of ''Rolling Stone'' gave the film a 3 out of 4, saying that "the suspense is killer".  Henry Barnes of ''The Guardian'' considered ''World War Z'' an "attempt at large-scale seriousness" in the zombie genre, which resulted in a "punchy, if conventional action thriller."
Conversely, Joe Neumaier of ''The New York Daily News'' said that ''World War Z'' "is no summer thriller. It's an anemic actioner that fosters excitement like dead limbs as it lumbers toward a conclusion."

'''''Ghost Town''''' is a 1988 American horror film directed by Australian director Richard McCarthy and starring Franc Luz and Catherine Hickland.
Kate (Catherine Hickland) is driving alone down a highway in Riverton, Arizona after having left her fiancé at the altar. While driving, she hears the noise of horses galloping outside her car, but sees no one. After pulling onto the side of the road, she is whisked away in a dust cloud and disappears.
Sheriff Langley (Franc Luz) is dispatched to Kate's abandoned car, found later that day. While pulled over, a man on a horse rides by and shoots at him. Langley exits the car, and a stray bullet hits the car's gas tank, causing the vehicle to explode. Langley wanders by foot, stumbling upon a ghost town off the main road. After falling asleep in an empty building, he awakens the next day to various apparitions that appear to be linked to the town's past. He meets a barmaid, Grace (Penelope Windust) and a blind gambling dealer (Bruce Glover), as well as a blacksmith and his daughter, Etta.
Meanwhile, Kate is being held captive by Devlin (Jimmie F. Skaggs|Jimmie Skaggs), a zombie-like outlaw who has control over the town through a pact he made with Satan. Devlin terrorizes the souls of the town's residents, and kills both the blacksmith and Etta after they confide in Langley. Upon discovering his gun to be ineffective, Langley is given an old revolver by Grace, and finds that he is able to kill Devlin's henchmen with gold bullets.
After finding Kate, Langley is hunted by Devlin's henchmen. The two hide in the abandoned church, which Devlin and his henchmen light on fire. However, Kate and Langley escape. Outside, Langley has a shootout with Devlin, during which Langley effectively destroys him. As he and Kate leave, the souls of the town's residents look on with approval, and the town disappears behind them.

*Michael Alldredge as Bubba
The script was written by Duke Sandefur, based on a story by David Schmoeller. The film was executive-produced by horror producer Charles Band.
''Ghost Town'' was shot on location in late September and October 1987
The film was released on November 11, 1988 in a limited release, only showing on eight screens. It opened the same day as United Artists's horror film ''Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play'' (1988), and grossed only USD$10,478 its opening weekend.
''Ghost Town'' received middling reception from critics, with ''TV Guide'' calling it "a mixed bag of pretty pictures and stale storytelling," noting its cinematography and performances as strengths, but faulting the script for being too predictable.
Critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a positive review, writing: "[''Ghost Town'' is an] imaginative fantasy thriller that has modern-day sheriff Luz chosen to rid a century-old town of its curse by avenging its dead sheriff in ''High Noon'' fashion. Fine special effects distinguish this modest sleeper."
In a retrospective assessment, film journalist Glenn Kay wrote: "[Franc] Luz does manage to keep a straight face, but the end result is unremarkable."
The film was released on VHS in 1989 through New World home video.
The film was released for the first time on Blu-ray by Scream Factory (licensed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) on July 28, 2015.

After a private eye named Larry botches an investigation, a college student's mother requests that Larry and his girlfriend Ayesha, also a private investigator, look into the disappearance of her son Kyle. After breaking into Kyle's dorm, they discover a large stack of VHS tapes and a laptop that is still recording a video. On the laptop, Kyle discusses the VHS tapes, saying where he got one of the most recent ones, and Larry tells Ayesha to watch the tapes while he inspects the house. As Ayesha watches the first tape, a figure peers out and watches her.
Ayesha calls Larry into the room, and they discuss the tapes' legitimacy. Larry tells Ayesha to continue viewing the tapes, which Kyle's video explains must be watched in the proper order "to affect you".
Larry re-enters the room and finds Ayesha in a hypnotized state with her nose bleeding. After being woken, she says she has a migraine. Larry leaves to find medicine, and a seemingly entranced Ayesha watches another tape. From the shadows, the figure crawls out and watches her.
Upon Larry's return, he discovers Ayesha lying on the floor with her gun in hand and a bullet wound in her head, implying she has killed herself. A VHS tape with the word "WATCH" written on it in lipstick, lies beside her. Larry picks up the tape and anxiously watches it.
Confused, Larry watches the webcam footage and sees Kyle explain that he and his mother want to make their own tape; Kyle then attempts suicide on-camera by shooting himself through his jaw, but seemingly survives, even though his jaw is completely ripped off, and runs off moments before Larry and Ayesha enter the dorm. An undead Ayesha suddenly attacks Larry. When he breaks her neck, she chases after him on all fours. Larry hides in a closet and shoots Ayesha in the face when she finds him. Larry hears a gurgling sound and explores the closet only to find Kyle hiding in the back. Kyle strangles Larry and afterwards gives the camera a "thumbs up", his plan being a success, and the recording ends.

After a car accident, Herman receives an ocular implant with a camera to replace his damaged right eye. The doctor warns that he may experience "glitches" because the implant is still in an experimental stage, and Herman notices a young red-haired woman staring at him on the way out of the hospital. That night at his home, he is haunted by a man and young girl, both of whom appear dead. Herman calls the doctor to demand that he remove the implant, and spends the night locked in his bathroom.
The next day, the red-haired woman, Clarissa, appears at his door, asking him if he is starting to see dead people. She reveals that she was born deaf and had an implant installed in her ear, which allowed her to hear but also gave her the ability to hear dead people. Herman suggests that if he has the implant removed the ghosts will go away but Clarissa explains that removing the implant will just keep Herman from seeing the ghosts, not send them away. She then asks if Herman has ever hurt anyone but he doesn't answer. Suddenly the ghost of Clarissa's "creepy" uncle appears behind her. She seems unaffected by this saying that he wasn't a very nice guy. She then explains that the ghosts become stronger when one pays attention to them, so they have sex in an effort to ignore them. Later that night, the ghosts of the dead man and young girl appear and an unseen force drowns Clarissa in the outdoor pool. Running back through the house in an effort to escape the ghosts, Herman again locks himself in the bathroom and uses a straight razor to cut out his eye. Herman then opens the door to escape but unwittingly runs directly into the ghosts who throttle him and stuff the eye, still attached to the razor, down his throat, presumably killing him.

Inside the building, they find the walls adorned in bizarre symbols, schoolchildren in classrooms, and women dressed in white garments. Malik overhears that his fiancée, Lena, is pregnant with Adam's child.
In the basement, Adam finds a bloody woman strapped to a chair who begins convulsing, causing him to run away.

Lena is abducted by several women in surgical apparel, and Malik is shot dead by one of the cult members. As Adam attempts to rescue Lena, an explosion knocks him down, and the cult leader then proceeds to explode in front of him. Adam finds Lena placed on an altar but is unable to save her as a horned demon tears its way out of her body. As Adam attempts to flee, he is attacked by the previously deceased cultists and schoolchildren, including Joni and Malik who have all turned into zombie-like ghouls. He eventually makes it to his car and attempts to drive away, but the demon chases him down and overturns the vehicle. As he attempts to crawl out, the demon calls him "papa", causing him to begin laughing hysterically, realizing that the demon is actually his child. Shortly thereafter, the camera malfunctions.

'''''Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse''''' is a 2015 American horror comedy film directed by Christopher B. Landon and written by Landon, Carrie Evans, Emi Mochizuki and Lona Williams. The film stars Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Joey Morgan, Sarah Dumont and David Koechner. Principal photography began on May 8, 2014 in Los Angeles, and it was released on October 30, 2015 by Paramount Pictures.
Three high school sophomores, Ben (Sheridan), Carter (Miller), and Augie (Morgan), are trying to recruit new members for their Scout group, led by their Scout Leader Rogers (Koechner). While Augie has always been happy about being a Scout, Ben and Carter have second thoughts. Carter tries convincing Ben to quit but he can't as Augie is about to get his Condor Patch. Their conversation of quitting is cut short when Ben accidentally hits a deer. They manage to get help from Carter's sister, Kendall, and her friends. Ben, who's had a crush on Kendall, gets some advice from her and they all see that the dead deer has vanished. Before they leave, the two are invited to the "Secret Seniors Party" and Carter is given the address. When they go to get alcohol for the party, they meet Denise, a cocktail waitress that works at a strip club. She and Ben hit it off and she agrees to buy the alcohol for them. The two then meet up with Augie in the woods so they can set up their campsite. That night, still concerned about the disappearance of Scout Leader Rogers, the trio talk about how great their friendship has been before heading to sleep. Before the night is out, Carter wakes Ben so they can attend the party. Augie catches up, however, and is disappointed by their choice. The two drive into town to find that the bouncer for the strip club is no longer there and they sneak in. The two are immediately attacked by a zombie bouncer and stripper before being saved by a shotgun wielding Denise. Augie goes to Scout Leader Rogers' house to find him, only to be attacked by Scout Leader Rogers as a zombie. Augie manages to deter him, and flee the scene.
Ben, Carter, and Denise go to the police station to discover that the town has been evacuated, before they are chased by a zombie horde into a holding cell. They wait for hours when the zombies hear music from outside and leave. Augie, seeing Ben's car, runs in and unlocks the cell, freeing them. They all escape and make their way down the freeway. After walking for a bit, the four are picked up by Corporal Reeves. They drive to the party to see if anyone is evacuated, only to find that the address that was sent to Carter was fake. The group starts to argue, but Reeves has been bitten before and turns into a zombie. Denise kills him and they try to get a signal on his radio. They hear information about bombing the town and start panicking. Carter then remembers his sister's diary has the party information in it. The four take the vehicle and drive to Carter's house. Once there, they manage to get the diary. But, more zombies arrive, and proceed to chase after the trio. They manage to escape using a trampoline to get to the now zombified neighbor, Ms. Fielder's house. From there, they take her car and head off down the road. The four find a dirt bike down the road and Denise takes it so she can get the military. Now left by themselves, Ben, Carter, and Augie weapon up at a hardware store and head to the party.
The zombies find the party, and proceed to attack the partygoers, until the trio turns up, armed with weapons and they proceed to kill the zombies.  Once they run out of ammo, they lock themselves in the building and the zombies follow them upstairs. Ben and Carter barricade the door when Augie reveals that he's built a bomb that was hidden in Ben's backpack. He manages to light the fuse when the zombies burst in and the three escape through a garbage chute just as it explodes, killing all the zombies. Denise and the military arrive at the scene, setting up medical tents and helping the survivors while the Scouts reconcile their friendship and Ben and Kendall kiss.

On May 30, 2014, Paramount Pictures set the film for a March 13, 2015 release date.
Principal photography began on May 8, 2014 in Los Angeles.
In July 2015, Paramount announced that it had struck a deal with AMC Entertainment and Cineplex Entertainment to make ''Scouts Guide'' and ''Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension'' available digitally, 17 days after they dropped below 300 theaters, as part of a larger experiment, and asked other theaters to join in. In return, Paramount would share an undisclosed portion of proceeds of the VOD revenues. Per industry sources, Paramount is gave participating exhibitors an estimated 2-4% share of the studio's digital revenue made between the time the film dropped below 300 theaters and 90 days after its opening date. The impetus for Paramount's experimentation with this approach, with these two-younger demographic genre movies-which many have deemed box office failures-is the theatrical failure of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM's ''Hot Tub Time Machine 2''. Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, said: "There is no question that we are going to do less theatrically, but I believe we will make it up digitally. This is about the long-term health of the business, so there is not this long period of time when a consumer can't watch a movie."
''Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse'' grossed $3.7 million in North America and $11.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $14.9 million, against a budget of $15 million.
The film opened on October 30, 2015, alongside ''Burnt'' and ''Our Brand Is Crisis''. The film was initially projected to gross $2-4 million from 1,509 theaters in its opening weekend but ended up grossing $1.8 million, finishing 12th at the box office.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 45%, based on 85 reviews, and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse'' fails to live up to its intriguingly wacky title, instead delivering yet another zombie comedy-thriller with a tired T&A twist."
The film was released on December 8, 2015 onto Digital HD and On Demand, and on January 5, 2016 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray.
